# Charlie's Gone, But the Show Went On: A Data-Driven Analysis of the Kutcher Transition in "Two and a Half Men"

## Introduction

Two and a Half Men" was a wildly popular CBS sitcom that followed the life of Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen), a carefree bachelor whose lifestyle is disrupted when his divorced brother Alan (Jon Cryer) and nephew Jake (Angus T. Jones) move in with him. The show became a cultural phenomenon, running for 12 seasons from 2003 to 2015.

The series faced an unprecedented challenge in 2011 when Charlie Sheen was dismissed following public controversies. Ashton Kutcher joined as a new lead character, creating a natural experiment in television - how does replacing a lead actor impact a show's success? This project employs data science and machine learning techniques to quantify that impact.
