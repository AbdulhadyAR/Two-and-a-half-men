Charlie Yes Ashton No,"Jan 5, 2022",8,99,3,"The show had a soul when Charlie Sheen was in it, and 8 i have given is because of that.

The episodes when Ashton, internet billionaire mambo-jumbo, came in deserve a pure 5. Mayve even a 4."
First 8 seasons are classic while the left are sucked,"Dec 20, 2013",8,338,20,"I'm giving 8 stars to the S1-S8. They are so funny to watch even repeatedly. To be honest, without Charlie,I never finish watching even one episode of S9 and I would not watch it any more. This show now is dead to me. I'd rather watch the former 8 seasons again and again. I like Charlie, Rose, little Jake, Berta and Evelyn in the show. At first I think this show is just for fun. But as I watch more, I realize that there are a lot of other things that I like which can make people stop to think. Charlie seems to be womanizing and nonchalant to his mother and brother at first. Yet I see a loving Charlie when Evelyn is vulnerable, when he comes into Jake's room to find the sulking Jake who is hiding in his room just because Charlie threatens Alan to move out. Rose loves Charlie so much and she is a good girl. So funny to see her head popping out from the deck. .... This show, S1-S8, is one of the best sitcoms in my eyes."
Charlie Sheen and a man and a half ;),"Nov 21, 2021",7,84,4,"It was only two and a half men until season eight, after that it was just a simple show, a pity ... The role of Ashton Kutcher was good, but this sudden turn of the story and the events that caused it, I could not follow with the same mentality as before, this show belonged to Charlie Sheen, is and will be."
There's absolutely no reason to watch this show anymore,"Apr 11, 2012",N/A,499,46,"Two and a half men doesn't deserve to go on,now that they've fired Charlie sheen and hired Asthon Kutcher as his replacement.This show is nothing without Charlie Sheen he was the main reason to watch this show.I have to admit this show started losing its's potential once Jake started getting older. It seems like every episode had the same plot Charlie sleeping with random women he doesn't care about and Alan whining about his social life,don't get me wrong this show was funny during the time Charlie Sheen was on the show.Ever since Ashton Kutcher came on this show its gotten very vulgar it seems like the writers have an obsession with farting,masturbation,sex,and bathroom jokes.Bottom line this show needs to be canceled."
"The show with Charlie Sheen gets a 10, the show with Ashton Kutcher gets a 1","Nov 16, 2022",10,45,3,"The chemistry between Charlie (Sheen), Jon Cryer (Alan) and the young Angus T. Jones (Jake) is magical. Especially when Jake was the age of the elementary school he was fabulous. What a talented young boy! Also all the girlfriends of Charlie and Alan were hilarious.

They feel like a real family. And it looks like they are really having fun with each other. Holland Taylor (Evelyn) and Conchata Ferrell (Berta) also did a great job. Then Ashton Kutcher came in. He spoiled everything with his awful bad acting. The chemistry between everybody vanished immediately. It looked like the cast did not enjoy it anymore. So we stopped seeing the show. Tried though."
"For me, it's over...","Jan 3, 2013",6,125,8,"Forget about watching the new episodes, with Walden Schmidt. Not only, the actor is not very talented, not funny nor the character is interesting, but also has the huge job of filling Sheen's shoes. Let's be honest, the show is nothing without Charlie Sheen. OK, Jake and Alan are also great characters. But the thing about this show was the issues between the two brothers and their trouble raising a kid. It makes no sense to change the main character. They should have cancelled it. No doubt the Charlie-Alan-Jake seasons are fantastic. But that is it. Forget that someone even tried to make episodes without one of those three. It's better to remember it as good show, as it was."
Classic!,"Jan 26, 2023",8,72,7,"Two and a Half Men is one of guilty pleasures. While not the best sitcom ever, it's still good. The show dropped down in quality a little bit when Charlie Sheen left and Ashton Kutcher took over. Charlie Sheen and John Cryer just had such great chemistry that it was going to drop a little in quality regardless who took over. The Sheen years were better than Kutchers but it's still decent with Kutcher. I would've like to see more with Sheen but unfortunately he lost his mind and had to be fired. The supporting actors are all pretty funny in this too. There are too many to name but they all do a good job. There's a reason that reruns are always on and that's because it's such a popular show."
Should end with Charlie,"Dec 28, 2019",6,36,1,"This show would get a higher rating if it ended with Charlies death, but they had to drag it on with Kutcher. He doesn't have the weight and celebrity status of Charlie Sheen to carry on the show"
Great Sitcom,"Apr 27, 2023",8,66,7,I have to say Two and Half Men has really grown on me over the years. It's always on so it's hard to miss but I've come to like it a lot. Like most people have already pointed out it was obviously a lot better with Charlie Sheen but I don't think it was as terrible with Ashton Kutcher as some people say. It was still watchable as long as you try to look at it as its own show and not compare the two. It's just too bad that Sheen went nuts because they could've probably got a few more good seasons with him and Cryer. This is one of those shows you can have on in the background as you're doing other stuff around the house because you've seen all the episodes several times.
Two and a Half Men died when Charlie Harper did.,"Oct 30, 2013",7,61,9,"Two and a Half Men was my all-time favorite TV show. I watched every episode when it aired from the series premiere up until Charlie's exit. Now, I see it time to time, and I couldn't be more disappointed with Chuck Lorre and his crew. Nothing against Ashton Kutcher, he's trying his best to be funny, but he and Jon Cryer don't have the amazing chemistry that Sheen and Cryer did. To pile on, Jake (Angus T. Jones) has now left the show, replaced by Charlie's 25-year old lesbian daughter, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn).

I'll admit that I do still watch the show occasionally, not because I enjoy it, but more out of curiosity to see how bad it can really get. In my opinion, if the writers had done it right (assuming that firing Sheen was right, which it absolutely was not), after Charlie's death, they should have bumped Cryer up to lead actor, with Jones beside him, and added a young boy to the cast, carrying the title Two and a Half Men. Now it's Two Men, a Lesbian and a Housekeeper.

The plot is getting more and more far-fetched and unbelievable. That, and the jokes are nothing new. Alan, get out of my Malibu beach house. Bring home a woman and sleep with her. Blah blah blah, what used to be funny is not funny the hundredth time. With or without Charlie Sheen, this show is years past its prime, and needs to be done. Eleven seasons is a good run. Jon Cryer is great, and deserves better than this. Charlie, you were the heart of this show. And it died when Charlie Harper died."
The series has become too long,"Oct 23, 2019",5,166,6,"With Charlie, the series was really funny. When Ashton replaced him, the actors became increasingly stupid and the gags became shallow and unwitting. The quality has dropped with Charlie's departure."
Ruined,"Sep 21, 2011",8,724,139,"Where once stood a proud and mighty hilarious comedy with Charlie Sheen now stands a terrible pile of garbage with Ashton Kutcher. If they had simply traded actors and kept the writing it would have been excellent, but does anyone else get the feeling that the writers left with sheen? Or it might be the fact that Charlie knew how to act in TV shows as where kutcher... well come to think of it where was he a good actor because in all the movies I remember him in he's always this really dumb guy who just walks around clueless. Perhaps he figured that would work on shows too, it didn't. Being a slacker in your movie carrier doesn't give you license to be an idiot in a beloved series, but thanks for ruining that for us well done producers you just firebombed a good show. 1/10 since season 9."
THIS SHOW DESERVES TWO RATINGS,"Sep 1, 2021",7,17,1,"IMDB should have the option of rating this show in two parts as follows Season 1-8 - Rating 10.

Rating 9-12 - Rating 1.

Charlie Harper was the soul of the show. The last 4 seasons are a torture to watch without him."
The show should have been canceled.,"Sep 21, 2011",1,323,37,"The show was awesome with Sheen. Without him, it's done.

Watching the first episode of the latest season, I would say that they couldn't have done much more to completely destroy the show. They brought in a completely different type of personality, one that I personally have no interest in.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Ashton Kutcher or his acting but he simply doesn't fit in this role. They should have tried to work things out with sheen or they could have just cut their losses and canceled the show.

Would they really expect any of the old fans to keep watching this?"
This show is so dead.,"Oct 20, 2011",N/A,163,22,"I gave it a chance, I believed in this season, I tried to like it, very hard, despite everything, but I just can't stand anymore. This show is dead! And don't get me wrong, I know that Kutcher have made some decent work in the past, take The Butterfly Effect for example, which I simply love to watch. I love this movie so much that I try to make like there's never been two lame sequels to it. It's just this one movie and that's it.

As about one of my favorite sitcoms of all time, sorry, but as much as Kutcher tries, there's no salvation to it.

I mean, Charlie Sheen is lots of fun, he can be an a**hole as a person, I don't care, but in the series, I used to LMAO with him and the rest of the cast.

Even the worst episode with Sheen is far better than this travesty now that they call Two and a Half Men Season 9.

Five episodes. No laughs, not even giggles. I'm done. The show is pretty dead to me.

As long as they don't bring Charlie back to this, do not even consider calling me to watch this garbage again.

3 stars in memory of what this show used to be once. A funny as hell experience. Now nothing but a travesty of itself.

Two and a Half Men (2003 - 2011) R.I.P."
Oh no.,"Oct 19, 2020",8,75,9,"I just heard about Conchata Ferrell (Berta).

She was very funny and had the best lines.

Nothing else to say.

I will miss her dearly

💜💜💜😘😘😘😘"
Awesome show,"Oct 15, 2020",7,29,4,"As long as Charlie Sheen was there it was an awesome show. After he left the show, later seasons felt dud."
rating just for 1-8 season,"Jun 18, 2020",10,33,3,Two and Half Men remake whit Charlie Sheen ? It will definitely be successful once again ;) I love this 1-8 season series.
Great show...... but just the first 8 seasons,"Sep 18, 2013",7,9,1,"In my opinion Two and a half men was one of the best TV show ever. I loved this show, it was very funny with likable characters and interesting storyline. Until the main character Charlie Sheen have been changed for Ashton Kutcher. I think that was a huge mistake. The show should have stopped with season 8. I rated it with 9 stars. Seasons 9 and 10 are quite watchable, but it is no more funny and it started to be awkward sometimes. It's not as good as before. My rating for these two seasons is 5.5. But after all I highly recommend this TV show for everyone who have not decided yet. Especially the first 8 seasons. You'll be satisfied and you're going to laugh a lot."
My review is only for the first 8 seasons.,"Apr 10, 2023",8,12,0,"This review is only for the first 8 seasons of the series. Because I heard a lot about how bad the last seasons were, I didn't even get to the point of starting watching them.

The writing: Good. Nothing special, but it's good: it has good jokes and the structure of the story is also good.

The acting: Very good from every actor! But in my opinion, mostly Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer bring out their best.

The direction: Let's call it good. But that's just ""good"" too, nothing special. I think this is as good as a series like this can get.

So in summary: the first 8 seasons are good. They have funny jokes, great acting and good direction."
The show was best with Charlie Sheen,"Sep 10, 2012",6,14,3,"I personally enjoyed this show a lot, especially when Charlie Sheen was on it. Now with Ashton Kutcher as the star, the show has died for me, and I don't watch it anymore.

In the time before Charlie Sheen's little breakup with the show, I enjoyed the show a lot. The jokes were humorous, the acting was great and I could easily point out the characters character. The usual shows I watch that have child actors, the child usually lacks in acting skills, but Angus T. Jones (Jake) was a great actor from the beginning.

I personally don't recommend this show as of the newest Season with Kutcher, just because the humor is dead and now the show seems like a drag, for Charlie was really the main character that made the whole plot fit together. Yet, I do recommend watching the episodes with Sheen, because I find those humorous."
Another great show that died a shameful death.,"Apr 16, 2018",1,105,12,"What can I say? This show should have ended when Charlie left but now we have 100 episodes of garbage that will be on tv everyday for the rest of our lives. 10 stars for Charlie, minus 5 for that second idiot."
Amazing ... but not season 9,"Jan 8, 2012",10,53,9,"The show is lovely, I mean all seasons except season 9 when Charlie Harper dies. Seriously, the first episode was just a disaster. Funeral ? Oh come on, Charlie deserved at least few tears (you Mr producer own this your audience !!!) From the bottom of his heart, Charlie was a good person. And then a new character came. A grown man who acts like a child. This is not funny. It's irritating. First 4-5 episodes were a disaster, then it started to be a little better but overall, the show lost all the chemistry which was between Charlie, Alan, Jake, Berta + Charlie & Alan's mother. In addition with Judith and Herb it was an amazing show.

Now it's just Alan trying to save the show, Jake being still fun but he's growing up and that's pretty much it. Walden is just a bad character. It just irritates me - when 30 year old (or whatever) person acts like a child it is not funny at all. And what's the point of him being undressed all the time ? Not funny at all.

Actually, by watching Season 9 I couldn't believe that one person can have such an impact on show. I loved that humor when Charlie wanted Alan to ""get out of my house"" but we all knew that at the end they loved each other. The show was ... natural. I could actually imagine such weird family. With Walden character I just can't.

If S1-8 were like Champions League, Premiership in football (in US - Soccer) then S9 is something around ... Division :( Bring back Charlie."
Not anymore...,"Feb 27, 2019",6,5,0,"The show was great and was very fun to watch but the day Charlie Sheen left the show the show became boring. The old non-funny lame jokes and non-funny sexual acts to keep the show alive. They just kept on adding adult-scenes to attract the audience and they were successful in doing that but audience doesn't matter because the show was lame in last 4 seasons. There is no reason to watch last 4 seasons. I stopped watching the series when the 9th season started, truth is charlie sheen was the only man keeping the show together, the day he left, there was no reason left to continue watching the season!

Also excuse the english, am not an American nor British."
charlie come back,"Oct 2, 2011",1,485,80,"10/10 with charlie 1/10 without him....

its like taking the motor out of a lamborghini and replace it with 2 pedals for the driver. its not a lamborghini anymore. face it.

the whole concept of the show is based on charlies character. it makes absolutely no sense to continue without him. the only reason they do, they want the money so hard, since two and a half men was the most successful TV show. a lot of people say sheen went crazy, i say: charlie was right when he flipped out and offended the producers. it doesn't look like they love what they do, they just love the money. he wants double the money? pay him and get him back, only way to rescue a sinking boat. the show will be cancelled soon, if they continue like this."
"season 9 oh dear, come back Charlie all is forgiven","Sep 27, 2011",N/A,88,15,"I guess all the talented writers walked out of this show right behind Charlie Sheen,you can't bash Ashton Kutcher for stepping in & taking on this role,it doesn't work thats blatantly obvious,Kutchers character is bland & boring & is in no way a fitting replacement for the Charlie Harper character,you got to feel a little sorry for actor Jon Cryer because without Sheen even his best efforts are falling flat. This show should have been cancelled & the remaining characters re- written into a new show focusing on Cryer being the main character,after 8 seasons i think he should have been given the chance more so than hiring a new actor to take over the staring role,both Jon Cryer & Charlie Sheen can raise a laugh with a simple facial expression a talent that sadly Ashton Kutcher does not seem to possess,Kutcher is a good actor thats obvious but he's the wrong choice for this show. the first episode was just embarrassing but the second was so bereft of comedy the writers should sit down and watch an episode of big bang & 2 broke girls to see how it should be done. Love him or hate him Charlie Sheen was the real reason for the success of this show & he will be sorely missed."
Seasons 1-8 are great!,"Mar 29, 2024",10,9,0,"I love this show so much. When I visited my uncle as a kid it was always in the background on the TV and I started watching it when I was about 20. It got me through some tough times in my life, also when I caught a fever pretty badly this show got me through it. That show means A LOT to me.

The dynamic between Charlie, Alan and Jake is great! Every character in this show is awesome in their own way. The setting of the Malibu beach house is refreshing and the non apologetic, non politically correct humor is awesome. The concept of the show is special, as most sitcoms follow some family or even more commonly a bunch of friends in the big city, but this show is special. It's about two and a half men.

(I was talking about the first 8 seasons. The post charlie era consists of okay episodes and really bad ones)."
Charlie yes; Ashton no,"Nov 17, 2023",7,4,0,"This was a great show. Charlie Sheen carried it on his shoulders for 8 seasons with many eye candies. Actors playing Rose, Mia, Chelsea, Melissa roles being the top eye candies. Megan Fox, Brooke Shields and few others made cameo appearances. Male celebrities list is too long.

It has memorable characters including Berta the house keeper, Rose the stalker, Melissa the receptionist, Judith, her second husband Herb, Berta's daughters.

Even after 12 years, I am watching it for the nth time for Charlie and the girls. Only grouse being they should have avoided bathroom jokes.

This was a clear 10 for me until Charlie was in it. I tried to watch some episodes in ninth season but my mind wasn't in it. Rating reduced to just 7."
Now What !,"Sep 22, 2011",9,46,14,"OK...this is my first review...and its on this show called TWO AND A HALF MEN...big fan of the show...Charlie harper's character killed of in the sitcom...which was obviously the greatest asset of the show...they could have replaced the character with another actor but the makers kill him off due to their personal differences with the actor...and they cast Ashton kutcher as Walden Schmidt who is exactly the similar to the character of that of Jon cryer...Allan...the only difference is the money ! i couldn't understand why rose,Courtney and Chelsea were talking bad about Charlie...except rose...who was cheated...the latter ended their relationship on good term....they are the biggest flaw of the episode...i thought the episode was exactly similar to that which was in season 6(the devil's lube) in which Charlie dreams that he is dead...and the homosexuality jokes with guest star stamos literally sucked ! Charlie's character being more degraded which the producers wanted...well they won but now the future of the show is uncertain...you win guys...but what about the other man and a half ? !"
Watch only the Charlie episodes,"Aug 19, 2022",7,6,1,"As everybody says, without Charlie there's no point to continue watching this show. What once was fine, funny, relaxing became indifferent, even annoying to watch with Aston Kutcher on the leading role. Such a shame."
"458th Review: My favorite show bar none, but Ashton. No. No. It's gone all sappy & horrible","Sep 27, 2011",8,28,7,"This used to be my favorite show - bar none. From series one to now; brilliant, vicious, acerbic, and just smart laugh-loud funny, which worked because Charley Sheen is the voice inside saying all the things we longed to say, an unrepentant rebrobate whose vitriol sold this over and over and over again.

In poker AK looks very pretty but often is one of the worst choices to bet big with; so with this AK. Ashton is so sappy, so lacking anything, that what we get is two Alans - and that just dies. Ungracefully.

Please stop. Stop now. No more. Don't ruin some of the greatest comedy writing ever on TV by reducing this to a soapy mess where the only joke is that AK is soooo good-looking that everyone swoons.

Will not be watching again. Going to start with the DVDs all again. I miss Charley...."
Only for John Cryer,"Apr 28, 2013",7,12,5,"Please excuse me in front, cause for my English-skills, cause I'm Dutch.

I've pretty much enjoyed all seasons of Two and a half men. I've followed it since the beginning, where Jake was still an overweight, little pain in the a**.

Charlie Sheen made the show for me, so I was shocked when he got into fights with the directors of this show and got replaced by Ashton Kutcher. Yes, Ashton is a good actor for some of us, but I never believe a thing he says or does in this show. (Sometimes I think even a monkey can act better then he does)

While seasons 1 - 8 were like a well baked steak, the seasons where Charlie's no longer among us, I would rate as a nice piece of fast food- meat. Not great, but it will fill your appetite in the afternoon whilst waiting for a real dinner.

The only reason for me to watch this show, is because of the fact that Jon Cryer really deserves lots of respect. This whole shows depending on his acting-skills (and Alan's misery). He's the only reason people should watch this show, cause without him this show would die a slow and painful death."
Two and a Half ...The wasted season??,"Sep 20, 2011",1,175,26,"I just watched episode one of the new season. None of it made sense. Why would Charlie marry Rose? Why would Rose push him in front of a train? Why would a stranger buy Charlies beach house and allow Alan, Jake AND Berta to stay???????? The question of why lingers, the quality of the show has taken a huge hit. Ashton Kutcher just plain doesn't fit, it's like taking a jigsaw puzzle piece that doesn't fit and trying to jam it into place, it won't work, and neither will Mr Kutcher. My wife and I have watched this series from day one.....that all stops now. It seems that Mr Lorre has lost his way, sure Charlie Sheen was a pain in the proverbial a....you know, but he was a vital piece to the puzzle, Mr Lorre should suck it up and bring him back. The only other option really is too cancel the show. Sure they could continue on with this sham, but the ratings will go down, week one everyone tuned in too see the circus, now that the circus is over, who will return to watch it again...not us."
Series Died with Charlie Harper,"May 19, 2013",10,14,2,"My rating of 10 is based on seasons 1-8 with Charlie Sheen. I have watched three shows with Kutcher and it is not same show and should be rated -10.

Sheen brought out the best in the supporting characters, while Kutcher seems to be one of many, which leaves the show without a lead character.

Without Sheen, Alan, Jake, and the rest of the cast are rudderless and though the same writers are still providing the lines, the show is flat, unfunny, and impossible to watch because it is so bad. If this show had been pitched with Kutcher instead of Sheen, it would have never become a TV series.

Another problem for the show with Sheen was Jake growing into a teenager since part of the appeal of the show was Charlie's lifestyle around a small kid.

Seasons 1-6 are the best with 7-8 a close second and everything after Sheen was fired being unwatchable."
Bring back Charlie,"Aug 2, 2019",7,3,0,As soon as Charlie died show started to suck it's was really unnecessary.
"After Charlie, it all went wrong","Jul 20, 2012",1,88,13,"Charlie should have gone after Rose to marry her. Ryan Stiles divorces Alan's ex and moves in with Alan and the kid, more believable. 2 exes from the same wife living together with the kid. Ryan is a great comedian and should have gotten the part. Don't like the new show at all,Ashton Kutcher totally makes this an entirely different show from the first one. Bad transition, Ryan is a WAAY better comedian than Ashton will ever be and he already had a position in the show. Should continue along the same storyline rather than write a new show. This to me is an obvious move, why could no one else see this? It's not that I'm Canadian like Ryan, it's just that I have seen Ryan and followed him since I first saw him on the Beachcombers show 100 years ago.I think he has been overlooked too many times."
We need Charlie back,"Oct 4, 2011",N/A,77,16,"I have an idea to get Charlie back. What if Rose threw the wrong guy under the train (because Charlie stepped back to look at all the girls). Charlie saw and is on the run trying to get home....probably sleeping his way home ;-) Waldon owns the house but could get back with his wife thanks to Alan's (Jake's?) help. Waldon is so grateful he gives the house to Alan as a big thank you. That's when Charlie shows up. Except now it's Alan's house and not his. Of course he can't afford to live there and does need Charlies money. What do you think? Could this work ? Good idea, bad idea???? I will really miss having this show on TV and if it keeps going the way it is people are going to stop watching. We need smart, not stupid humor. Where did the writers go.....did they leave too???"
This rating is for Charlie,"Mar 5, 2022",9,6,0,"But this review is not. I believe the creators of the show were extremely disrespectful to the person that actually created the whole thing. Without Charlie, this is not a TV show. This is a pathetic attempt at recovery and a failed one at that. The writers really believe that they don't need Charlie and that is just sad. They obviously do and everything in the show proves that. Their pathetic attempts at extreme events that unfold or simply the ratings just show that this was not a succesfull attempt at keeping the show alive. It was better off dead and buried because then it would be at least remembered well. Before Ashton I was eagerly watching the show without even missing a sentence. After Ashton it just became something I watch in order to fall asleep and I am not exaggarating here. I really didn't like how they handle their attitude towards Charlie too. The jokes they did, the angles they took to look and things they said about Charlie were simply very disrespectful and goes to show how petty the writers actually were. Petty is the important word here. I don't know what Charlie did or how their relationship was and I'm sure he did many mistakes too. But mixing their personal opinions about him with the character he brought to the show is just sad. Without Charlie, you wouldn't even make after the pilot. The first time I watched the show, after watching two episodes with Ashton Kutcher, I was just extremely disappointed and didn't watch the rest. Then after years, when I was rewatching the show, I decided to finish the show this time. As you see, my idea didn't change. After charlie, the show is purely unwatchable. But the worst thing was how they disrespected him in the last episode. Goes to show that none of the writers or producers were professional people and they mixed their personal feelings with the show, and they messed it up. Even a bigger failiure than ending of Game of Thrones. If you are going to watch it, I suggest save yourself the pain, consider this an 8 season series and leave it there."
Great Through Season 8 - Horrific After That!,"Feb 12, 2025",7,3,0,"Such a funny and great situational comedy watching young Jake grow up with his father and uncle Charlie. While living in his uncle Charlie's beach house and his dad going through a divorce. Many, many hilarious situations that any of us that have been parents can relate to, including those of us that have been divorced. It's a terrible shame that personal issues between the producers and Charlie Sheen resulted in the death of the show (in my opinion). The shows entire persona was ripped out of the show when they decided to fire Sheen and ""kill"", him off. From season 9 onward, this show steadily declined into a real mess. And the producers, not just pleased with themselves for canning Sheen, disrespect him through the writing. My advice, watch Seasons 1 - 8 and avoid the season 9 - 12 debacle!"
S01-s08 8/10,"Aug 8, 2019",8,15,4,"Season 1 to season 8 8/10 after Charlie left the show was pretty much shit, go watch anger management after you finish two and a half men"
Was awesome at the beginning,"Dec 10, 2023",6,3,0,"I'd give it 9 if not 10 for the first few seasons, but then...

They made Jake dumb as a cork, that's -1 Charlie dropped out, that's another -1 And all this business with fake gays, so cringe, another -1

The finale is full of fun (and not very fun) references, but overall, I wasn't very pleased as they hinted us about something, which never happened (no spoilers) :D

Would recommend to watch, especially while Charlie is there. I finished it all and don't regret it, but it was going slowly downhill since probably season 6-7, but that's the fate of almost all long-run TV shows. Well, except for Friends and Everybody Loves Raymond :D."
Charlie you the man! Good pickup and a winner for CBS.,"Mar 27, 2006",10,106,62,"It's nice to see one of my favorite actors back in the mix of things, now three seasons in. Charlie Sheen now has one of the better hit shows on TV. This is funny well written and sex driven material that keeps the whole show interesting. Good story lines with Charlie Sheen as a liberal California womanizer, who takes in his divorced brother a nervous and conservative Alan played by the funny Jon Cryer, and then his son the adorable Jake played by Angus T. Jones who adds sugar to the cake round out a fine trio of men, who despite differences in lifestyle help one another out along the way and live as a big happy family. Always being a big Charlie Sheen fan it's nice to see him have success like this, even though it's coming on TV and not the big screen movies, he can still be a major factor in any comedy parts as it has been proved with this gem."
Sad to see that Chuck has written his last Vanity Card,"Feb 20, 2015",7,4,1,"The wife and I watched this comedy series for the first several seasons and we could not get enough of the Harper boys and their endless stream of family fiascos. We found the series to contain a great deal of first class comedy as well as some risky and frisky liaison's that pushed the envelope for prime time television. We would watch the reruns at all times of night and weekends and even if we saw the episode(s) previous multiple times we just laughed our butts off and waited for those classic Harper lines written by Chuck Lorre and his team of talented writers.

So a few years back Charlie Sheen experienced a very public physical and mental breakdown which gave him the courage and stupidity to declare he had tiger blood running through his veins and that not even the producer/writer Chuck Lorre could prevent him from continuing with his series and wowing the audience.

So the network responded to Charlie Sheen's public meltdown by sending Charlie off to marry Rose (Melanie Lynskey) at the end of season 8. At this time everyone wondered how Charlie would be written out of the series to allow it to continue on so Charlie and Rose took their honeymoon to France where Charlie somehow accidentally fell in front of a train and died. Well Mr. Sheen just remember that the producers always have the last say, and that their writers will say it for them. In your case Mr. Sheen, your tiger blood was run over by one man who happened to be both the writer and producer of your number one top television series for the network. Season 8 ended on a high note with the funeral for Charlie Harper whereby his family and his many ex-lovers eulogized good old Charlie at his funeral.

As season 9 approached Charlie was replaced by the capable and younger actor Ashton Kutcher who played Walden Schmidt and who valiantly tried to sustain the series success or mere existence for the next four years. I believe the lower ratings would have required the series to be canned, but the network executives pride would not allow them to admit that there were no winners, only losers as the series continued to wane since the demise of Charlie Harper.

The very last episode in season 12 was a two-part story line where we discover that Rose had been lying to everyone these past four seasons and that she actually had kept Charlie alive in her basement wishing well that she had built so that he could not escape. But alas, Charlie finds a way to escape Rose's basement wishing well and he texts his brother Alan and Walden that he seeks revenge upon them. He also writes his mother a not so nice note upon his escape telling her what he thinks of his cruel mother.

Although we never see Charlie in the closing two part episodes Mr. Lorre wanted to ensure he let the audience know in no uncertain terms that there was no love lost between him and Charlie. The closing scene reminds me of a scene from the western film Django where the director Quentin Tarantino inserted himself in to the film with a cameo appearance whereby he had himself blown up with dynamite. It was so cool! Mr. Lorre also inserted himself in to the very last scene in Two and a Half Men and he was more than fair in the way he closed out Two and a Half Men after 12 seasons. Please don't miss his last vanity card at the end of the show as it is quite the epitaph to the series and sums it up quite nicely.

Since the wife and I always considered the first several seasons to be a 10 plus rating and as the series declined gradually year after year through seasons 9 through 12, I have rated the series an overall 7. The series had a great cast, excellent writers, some surprise guest appearances, but without Charlie Sheen, the writing could not keep up with the loss of Charlie Harper's immoral character. Congrats on making billions of dollars Mr. Lorre, we had quite a few great evenings watching Two and a Half Men and we can't wait for a special edition of the complete series to come out as a box set."
Bring Back Charlie Sheen,"Nov 26, 2011",1,228,49,"It went from my favorite show on television to my not watching it anymore after the first new episode. Gratuitous nudity, bad chemistry....need I go on?

Now, I like Ashton Kutcher, he is just in an untenable position trying to replace the genius of Charlie Sheen, as well as, the character of Charlie Harper.

The interaction between Charlie, Alan, Jake, Berta, Evelyn, and all the other regulars cannot be recreated. It just doesn't work for me without the chemistry that was there prior to this season.

I don't approve or disapprove of Charlie Sheen's personal lifestyle. But, the show was HIS and his alone. He is irreplaceable.

Please find Charlie alive and living in Encino...

Bring him back."
"With Sheen 8, without not even 1","May 31, 2019",8,14,4,Sheen was the show. If the producer couldn't handle a pre-madonna actor then he should have gone (to some other industry) and not Sheen.
Separate it...,"Feb 10, 2024",7,4,1,"I would like IMDB if let us to leave 2 separate review, with Charlie Sheen it was an enjoyable show 7/8 stars... With Sheen actually funny punchlines, had a solid chemistry and storylines, obviously he was kind of playing himself in the show (thank god Kutcher didn't hit on teen girls as he did in real life). I understand he crossed the line, and was terrible to work with by the end ... With Kutcher it was unwantchable 1/2? As soon as he joined the chemistry flew out of the window, his terrible acting/ written character was just made the whole show to a pain to watch. I knew he is terrible but reached new lows..."
RIP MEN - Like Batman and Robin Without Batman,"May 21, 2012",1,117,22,"I write here today as a long time, huge fan of Two and a Half Men, or what it was before Charlie Sheen was killed off. I started watching THM back in 2003 when it first aired. I was about thirteen years old at the time. I grew up on this show, it became a part of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and into my college years, I knew that every Monday night at 9PM I could sit down, relax, and watch one of my favorite TV shows. Whether a new or old episode, I always laughed at THM. I can honestly say of all the shows I've watched in my life this would be in my top three favorites.

In the later seasons however, for those that have been living under a rock the show's main star Charlie Sheen began to slip. He started having marital, drug, and drinking issues. It started cut into his time with the show, and soon episodes would be cut including an entire season down the drain. It made me very sad to see Charlie Sheen go downhill because I really respected him and admired his work on THM. I don't support or condone what he did, but what I am more upset at is the backlash from CBS, primarily Chuck Lorre. It was announced in summer 2011 that Aston Kutcher would replace Charlie Sheen in a new role on the show. I had no idea how they were going to do this but I accepted for what it was for a while. I did not like the sound of this, but more importantly, I GAVE ASTON KUTCHER A CHANCE. I am a fan of his previous work in movies and film and I was curious to see what he could bring to the table. Also I was looking forward to getting more new episodes of THM rather than episodes skipped because of Sheen's bad behavior.

The day came. September 19, 2011. Nearly 30 million peopled tuned in to watch Aston Kutcher as Waldon Schmidt fill the shoes of the now dead Charlie Harper. The first episode in my opinion completely bombed. There was absolutely no chemistry between Aston Kutcher and Jon Cryer. But I kept my mouth shut. I continued to watch, week after week, until I just couldn't take it anymore. Let me just say this. The new format of Two and a Half Men is the definition of complete and utter s**t. The writing is horrible now. Kutcher has no chemistry with any of the cast. His British girlfriend that stuck around the whole season is very annoying. Alan is now an annoying, pathetic loser that doesn't make sense on the show anymore. And Jake? That adorable, witty kid from the past seasons? Turned into a complete loser, pothead. Maybe he was already heading that direction but that's beyond the point.

This show is ruined and I point the finger at Chuck Lorre and CBS. Yes, Charlie Sheen had problems, but why couldn't he get help? A long time ago he came out of rehab like a perfectly normal person. This is just people picking on someone with serious health problems. Instead of getting him help and postponing the show on his behalf, what do they do? They fire him and completely ruin the show. If they really disliked his behavior I believe they should have just indefinitely ended the show. They could have always brought it back some how down the road but now it's ruined. My whole problem with everything is that this whole matter is a huge insult to every fan like me who has tuned in for the past nine years. Aston Kutcher is a fine actor but he just doesn't work on this show. The writing sucks, the story sucks, and it's time to let it go. When I want to watch THM, I will go to the reruns. If you are new to the show maybe you can get used to the new format but for me, it will never be the same again. Chuck Lorre, I admire your work but in the events of what you have done to this show, I can honestly say to you go to hell!"
Three Words,"Oct 6, 2011",N/A,51,12,"Bring back Charlie!

OK, I've only seen a few episodes but as much as I like Ashton he isn't a blink on Charlie and his role sucks. John's character is out of whack now too. Too much Alan, and not in the same vain as the character I use to love. Confident, in control Alan is not what I want to see. Jake rocks but Bertha moving in is plain disturbing. Sheen may have blown it but if the producers know what's good for this awesome series they'll all get over themselves and bring back Charlie. His character is what this this show is all about. There was definitely something special about the dynamic of all the characters pre Charlie having a brain fade. Somehow the show managed to take a simple dynamic of all the characters and consistently come up with fabulous story lines. The show needs someone with the arrogance of Charlie. His dynamic with every other character was awesome and incredibly well crafted. Ashtons character is way too weepy for his ex. I keep wishing he'd grow some balls, like Charlie had. Sadly I'll be confined to the re-runs with Charlie in them. He was the show. Sorry producers but you took the jam out of my doughnut when you killed off Charlie. Let's hope you come to your senses and resurrect him before the show bombs completely."
Best ever!,"Oct 19, 2006",9,137,94,"I love this show! It's an amazing mix of dirty humour and amusing 'real life' situations. It's very enjoyable for a laugh and some fun!

The entire show appears to be dedicated to making the audience laugh at the character's dilemmas and it is very amusing to see how everyone's situation entwines and makes into a large but hilarious plot!

The entire cast is very amusing and their voices, attitudes, appearances and body language portray their characters to their full potential.

I DEFINITELY recommend that you watch this show. At least watch several episodes to get a taste of it. I can almost definitely guarantee you'll be hooked!"

Hilarious throughout its entire run,"May 5, 2019",10,24,11,"When his wife kicks him out of his house, a man is forced to move in with his brother in the latter's beach house in Malibu. Over the course of this he will try to move back out. It does not go well. No one really wants to live with him and he can't afford to live by himself. Really, the only reason he is allowed to stay there at all, is that his 10 year old kid is adorable. Stupid, yes, cute, also yes. And they are a package deal. Later a young rich guy moves in. These are our four leads.

Alan(Cryer, incredible) has been a people pleaser since childhood. Teacher's pet. Straight A's. It never worked particularly well for him. No one can stand him except for teachers and their ilk. He's been bullied forever, by peers and elders alike. He makes a living, such as it is, as a chiropractor. No one in his family wants him to treat them, in general people don't want to do things for him, and everyone makes sure to tell him that, in their opinion, he's not a real doctor. While he gets better at flirting, he certainly isn't what you would call ""adept at it"". Almost no women want anything to do with him. This means he gets incredibly excited when one does. And that he finds himself engaging in perversions. The ones he's developed over a lifetime of abuse. And those of anyone desperate enough to get with him. Yes, those are connected. It's not just that he's creepy by default. It's also in the things he does. What he says, what he thinks about. And he's never particularly capable of hiding those from others. His low wages and the high cost of his alimony payments leave him with very little money to spend. Even so, he is immensely cheap. This drives away a lot of his limited selection of lovers. He does have an on again off again relationship with Lindsey(Thorne-Smith, amazing). And that's where he gets a real taste of his own medicine. He is demanding, passive-aggressive, and despite sometimes making an effort, does simply not live up to others' expectations. And she can be the exact same. Right back at him. A bunch of the time he does, just barely, give her what she wants. Still, she knows she can do a lot better. She's settling for him. And boy does she let him know that that's what's going on. No, she has no trouble getting someone much better. She's just relieved that she doesn't have to try hard. What's he going to do? Find someone else? Yeah. When pigs fly.

Charlie(Sheen, fantastic) never had to work hard for anything ever. His jingle writing is ridiculously easy. It pays extremely well, let him buy a big place. All he has to do to convince a woman to have sex with him is show that he has the aforementioned. However. After a while he is no longer satisfied. Yes, he was always quick to lash out, whenever he isn't drinking, gambling or humping his way through life. Make snide personal remarks at someone who doesn't deserve them. Out of the blue. Anyway. He tries to make long-term relationships work. And it is outstanding. Will it work with Mia(Vaugier, who tries to improve his lifestyle)? Maybe Chelsea(Jennifer Taylor, who wants more out of being with him then take out, TV and copulation)? What about Courtney(McCarthy, who seems like exactly his type - including that you can't depend on her)?

Jake(T. Jones, great) is lazy, dumb, perpetually hungry, and basically never wants to do anything other than eat and play video games. Over the course of this he changes. At first he isn't interested in a girlfriend. Later he will do absurdly poorly on dates. He will genuinely believe that his crass, puerile interests will, at all, impress any female, and when talking about them, he shows that he can really dig deep into a topic and analyse it. It's just never something that he can actually use. Not in school and not in life. This show focuses a lot on how he is negatively influenced by his uncle. As he grows up he is no longer too young for all of it. And yet there is a lot that no one should ever engage in regardless of age.

Walden(Kutcher, phenomenal) became a billionaire when he sold to Microsoft something he didn't have to work on for very long. Then he married his high school sweetheart. He was 19 years old at the time. As he hasn't matured emotionally since then, she divorces him. He tries to get a new monogamous partner. Might it work with Zoey(Winkleman, British and refined)? She's a lawyer and finds his immense generosity very attractive. The two have strong on screen chemistry. Her hostile ex-husband is the bane of her existence. They did have a sweet, now 6 year old, daughter together. And he does grow to be a more adult person. Some of the inventions he comes up with are genuinely right out of science fiction, including mind reading. He starts working with his old partner Billy(Oswalt, always good to see him in things) again even though the two of them despise each other. The man had a complete nervous breakdown!

This has an endless stream of racy material that just barely got by the censors, and it gets increasingly offensive each season. I very rarely give a perfect rating to something I review, but this continued to make me laugh throughout the entirety of every single episode. Since I had heard that it did not remain hilarious all the way, I kept waiting for the quality to drop. And it never did. It continued to change enough elements every so often that it remained fresh for 12 years. I recommend this to anyone who likes raunchy, dialogue driven jokes and sitcoms. 10/10"
Character's review,"May 12, 2021",7,2,0,I really hate this Alan character He sucks and his son at the beginning Jake was cute but then he became a disgusting monster.
Ending A Good Series Before It Goes Bad,"May 11, 2023",8,0,0,"The series should have ended after the eighth season . After Charlie was fired , Jon Cryer was trying to be the funny star which he wasn't . Jon Cryer was always the straight man and just another supporting player behind Charlie Sheen . Hiring Ashton Kutcher was good , but after a few episodes they should have fired Jon Cryer or reduced Jon's part in the series . All the rest of the supporting characters were way better than Jon , especially Rose , Berta , Evelyn , and Jake . The 12th season was the worse , the series finale was pure garbage . And now Charlie Sheen is working with Chuch Lorre on a brand new series , and it will be a winner . Hopefully there will be a part for Melanie Lynskey ."
Was best when Charlie was on his own.....,"Sep 19, 2020",7,2,0,"Seasons 1 through 6 were the best, before Charlie got ""saddled"". From that point on, it headed to the dumpster. Once ""she"" showed lost its edge. And when Charlie left, it was over. I've only watched one episode with Ashton and it wasn't even close."
It was just bad,"Sep 20, 2011",1,401,132,"The writers should have been fired. They made Charlie a drunk that was funny and now they made the ""New ""two and a half men just sucked. It was painful to watch. It was not funny at all. Our whole family hated it. Will not be watching your show any more. Do not blame Charlie for what your writers made him. So the only people that lose here are the cast and the only winner is no one because we lose a good show. Ask Charlie really nice to come back and maybe you will get back your good reviews. Making him a drunk that looked for whores was done by your writers not him. He just took the role beyond the TV screen. Which really helped out your ratings. But now you have nothing but a mess on YOUR writers hands."
It was the show's funeral the day Charlie Harper dies,"May 16, 2019",10,4,0,"So i have never seen the show when it was actually running, but thanks to Amazon Prime. I watched it for the first time in 2018 and from since that day, i have seen this show roughly 5 times (uptill season 8 end only tho). Contrary to many people, i was able to watch the show till the end after Charlie dies, however i did that just once, after that i used watch till season 8 to re-start from season 1. Giving a 10 rating to preserve my fav shows ratings. However must watch atleast untill season 8 end."
Good for about 7 seasons,"Nov 21, 2024",7,2,0,"Two and a Half Men was criticized back in it's time for it's ""Simple"" humor but the truth is it always had a good mixture of simple humor and intellectual humor, making it appealing to casual viewers as well as brainy viewers. It gradually got better as Jake got older and started to understand things. Personally I think Season 1-7 was absolute gold but starting in Season 8 you could tell that Charlie was not in his right element. Suddenly he looked 15 years older, drained and exhausted. He showed up at work every day with a hangover and it was hard to ignore. Season 9-12 is not really worth talking about as we all know how it ended up.. Got nothing against Ashton Kuther, he's a fine actor but Two and a Half Men was a poor match for him.. And the writers obviously didn't care anymore at that point, it got lazy and heavily dumbed down to the point where it was more stupid than funny.

This once great show sadly did not stay the course but I can still recommend Season 1-7. It's comedy gold!

7/10."
Tasteless humor,"Nov 26, 2012",1,62,17,"I have stopped watching two and a half men. The reason is most of the jokes are in poor taste.

I think they went too far when Lyndsey aka Courtney threw up on Walden's plane and She is always passing gas.

Also having Rose come back and cuff and gag Walden is in poor taste as well.

Alan is just too wimpy for my taste and is getting worse.

I can see why CBS put it behind Big Bang Theory. I think it lost viewers after the newness of Aston wore off.

And no Angus aka Jake is telling people to stop watching the show. Okay Angus you get $250, 000 per episode. I hope you saved a lot of money as You are not as cute as you were when you were 8.

Stepping off my soap box"
most creative joke writing I've ever seen in years,"Apr 16, 2004",N/A,300,126,"This show flat rocks!

Charlie Sheen has a reputation for being a wild child, John Cryer plays the perfect neurotic boob, and the writers play perfectly into the juxtaposition of the two. Toss in a juvenile (Angus Jones, aka Jake) and the scenes become flat hilarious, as the adults attempt to deal with often raunchy mature topics, while keeping the kid in the dark.

This show has some of the best creative writing I've seen in years. No clichéd 'dumbed-down for the masses' or hackneyed pratfalls here, all are setup and timed with perfect execution by the players. Some of the darkest, driest and quick-witted performances on TV in years, very reminiscent of the quirkiness and off-the-cuff repartee of Woody, Norm, et.al. on Cheers. One of the best original laughs on TV these days, hope it survives for a long time! A real treat, amidst all the dumbed down humor that's seems to prevail everywhere else."
A TV classic that should never have replaced its star,"Oct 25, 2021",10,4,0,"What can I say about Two and Half Men? I arrived to liking this show well after its run finished. While it was on I was always too busy to get into it and thought it campy with Charlie Sheen. However, watching it later on I have to say the pure comedic genius behind the show with Sheen and Cryer is just unparalleled. It's the type of show you can watch over and over and never get tired. The tragedy is the falling out between Lorre and Sheen that caused the latter's demise from the show. Egos should have been swept aside. Season 8, Charlie's last, leaves one feeling nothing but what-ifs for the show. Kutcher was a decent replacement for 2 of the 4 seasons he aired on, but nothing replaces the magic of the original cast. I, for one, would love to see a new season created picking up where season 12 leaves off with Charlie coming back (minus the cartoonish like finale sequence). What do you say Hollywood? In the age of reboots, let's do this thing right and bring back the magic."
Extra isn't always better,"Jul 19, 2021",7,2,0,"As almost everyone, feelings are same that when your main character is gone, you create a proper ending & say goodbye. But money huh! Producers seemed as greedy ad Alan was for the house.

From season 9, everything seemed forced, like Alan and Walden's friendship. When Walden use to describe it which was frequently, it seemed how on earth did Alan meant that much🙄

Talking about alan, he became more annoying than funny. I don't know if that's what they wanted but c'mon it's a sitcom, I don't wanna get annoyed.

That's lot like about the 1st epi where they made Charlie the villain of every single woman. And let's Just not talk about the finale."
The show was all Charlie Sheen's acting and Chuck Lorre's writing,"Jan 10, 2019",10,4,0,"The show is a winner all the way and the main reason behind the success that it got was Charlie Sheen's acting and Chuck Lorre's writing. It was the combination of these two things which made the show a great show. Well, yes there are double meaning dialogues and it is not a show that you can watch with your family but then they never claimed it to be. This show has limited setup and most of the events happening are happening inside Charlie's magnificent house at Malibu. Charlie is a womanizer and Alan, his brother is desperate loser and is going through his divorce along with handling a growing kid, who is really dumb at time and really smart at other times. Alan gives away a lot of alimony and does not have a place to live so he comes to stay at Charlie's house. The series begins from there. He has a son called Jake. Jake is a kid with whom we all have grown. There are limited characters in the show around which the entire story revolves like what happens in most sitcoms and then there are are series of guest stars which make this show even better with their presence. I have seen the entire series at one go back in my college. I didn't leave my house, I remember, for an entire week and would finish an entire season episodes in one day. I was so much impressed with the character of Charlie Harper played by Charlie Sheen that I started emulating him in my college. I love every episode of the show but some scenes are my favorite like ""Boobra's ma'am"", ""No more alimony"" or ""Something will turn up"" are some scenes which I have seen again and again. I even love characters from the show that does not have much presence in the show but I still adore them and one of those characters is Kandy played superbly by April Bowlby. I absolutely love the way she portrayed her character and the lines written by Chuck Lorre for her were just amazing. Every other character too make a mark on this show like Charlie and Alan's mother, Evelyn Harper is extremely good, Bertha the housekeeper is great and is one of the fan favourites, Alan's wife played by Marin Hinkle will make you fall in love with herself even though she is always breaking Alan's ball making you feel bad about Alan, Rose is another character whom you love at times and hate at times for her obnoxiousness but who makes the show empty without her presence. After the infamous exit of Charlie Sheen from the show, Chuck Lorre brought in Ashton Kutcher who couldn't fill the gap left by Sheen, which means that no matter how good the writing, if the good actor is not there, the show won't run. I mean Kutcher is good actor and we all loved him in 70's show but this show ain't for him. Sheen in retaliation and in arrogance started another show called Anger management but again it didn't work because what also worked for TAHM was also its great writing and one-liners written by Lorre himself which also became part of the cult. Nonetheless whatever happened behind the show is not something we as the audience should be concerned about rather we should see the show for its art and entertainment that it provides. The show is timeless and you can pick any episode from the show, even if you haven' seen previous episodes, you will enjoy it. Ten years later, when I first watched it, I still go to Prime and occasionally watch an episode or two just to get myself into a good mood. Absolutely recommended."
Dice it,"Mar 20, 2025",7,2,0,"Two and a half men is about three characters. The half-Jake. The kid. Great for laughs when he was young. Then there is Uncle Charlie (Charlie Sheen). The lean mean stud machine with the house at Malibu who provides a house for Jake and his getting divorced/divorced dad-Alan. Alan is a weak, whining pathetic character who is so irritating that he ruins the show. And he is incredibly cheap. Unfortunately three things happen. Jake gets older. Charlie Sheen is tossed off the show. That leaves the most obnoxious character, Alan. And a fill-in for Charlie Sheen. Here is where the remote comes in to play."
Great Series with Sheen,"Aug 18, 2020",10,4,0,I spent one week watching in the evening the first 8 seasons of this series. I laughed until my eyes watered. Chuck Lorre should reboot this series but only with Charlie Sheen.
A regrettable change of actors and characters,"Jan 8, 2022",7,2,0,"Excellent, until unfortunately they have to expel Charlie Sheen, was the soul of this excellent series. I understand the anger of the studio and production, but it seems to me a lack of respect to who made this series successful, that they have replaced the presentation poster, even here on the IDM website itself, the presentation you see is with Ashton Kutcher. Without Charlie Sheen as the main character, I would have seen no future for this sitcom. He brought the perfect charisma and the chemistry of him with the other actors was irreplaceable, to the point that after the introduction of Ashton Kutcher, I stopped seeing her completely."
Good&funny untill....,"Nov 29, 2018",1,7,0,"Ashton replaced Charley. It became horrible, lame, not worth watching."
Two And A Half Men hilarious with Charlie dreadful with Ashton,"Dec 3, 2011",10,12,4,"I am rating Two And A Half Men 10 for all the laughs I have had over the years, but only with Charlie. Two And A Half Ashton is not the same show and is on a whole other level because it is the worst show on television today. I really think the role was cursed no matter who tried to replace Charlie Sheen because the entire show revolves around his life, the women he meets, and his family. You can't build a series based off of one guys life and get rid of him years later. Aston Kutcher is a good actor and im a fan but you can't stand to see his face on Two And A Half Men. Is it his fault? No I don't think it's Ashtons fault but the writers for making his character Waldon try to act like Charlie Harper and failing miserably. Waldon tries to be this ladies man like Charlie but comes off as a very bitter, scruffy looking guy with 8th grade jack off jokes and hes not funny at all. The way he comes into the picture also doesn't make any sense and it is retarded. I would call this season of Two And A Half Men the cancer of CBS and a wake up call for the next Hollywood jerk with an ego that tries to revive something that is so obviously dead. Please let this go Chuck you were wrong and Charlie was what made this show work."
Funny at first,"Apr 4, 2022",7,2,0,This show was great when Charlie Sheen was in it. After he left the attempts at comedy was forced. The sexual innuendo was over the top and sophomoric at best.
Ashton kinda blows as Charlie,"May 10, 2012",1,27,9,"I like Ashton he was absolutely great in that 70s show. Of course that was a much less demanding role and he wasn't the ""star"" but more of a mixture of shared starring roles. This is much more demanding as he is not only needing to be funny, charming, amusing, clever and the primary star all while he fills the shoes of Charlie Sheen who did all of these things well (even while recovering from his tigers blood binges).

I watched and hoped and watched some more in the hopes it would work or eventually improve. I even came back after skipping a few to see if it had recovered from the initial struggles to rediscover their funny MOJO or even improve over the sad train wreck of kindergarten masturbation jokes and the cheeky but boring Brit girlfriend (like a female Pierce Morgan makes me want to slap myself in the face with the remote every time she tries to be funny and fails yet again what a surprise) and well it wouldn't even be bearable if it didn't have Berta and Jims wife (playing as Alan's girlfriend). Ashton should make a serious go at trying to move up in roles from cheap crass vulgar comedy to something serious (but Please nothing like that horrible gigolo movie he did (that was another train wreck OH Lord!)

Mostly all of it doesn't work any longer. The maker should swallow his pride and try to get Charlie back on at quarter pay or something. Worst case sell the show to Charlie - if Charlie owns it he would probably stop the dope and locking whores in his closet long enough to get serious about making some meaningful comedy moments. Just saying sadly the show is mostly dead and just waiting for the doctors to stop trying to revive it and make the time of death call.

Prior to the whole ""J"" word fiasco before the producers pride and dignity was apparently injured beyond repair (yeah right) this was a pretty fun show rat it about an 8 out of 10 but now it is complete garbage. Not entirely Ashton's fault he just tried and failed to fill some very big shoes. True."
THE ONLY DECENT NEW COMEDY SERIES ON TV,"Jul 19, 2004",N/A,227,125,"I love this show. It's funny, bright, irreverent, and like nothing else on the tube these days. Charlie Sheen was an excellent save in SPIN CITY, but he's perfectly cast as the lazy, womanizing single guy who writes ad jingles for a living, and whose space is invaded by his nerdy brother, Jonathan Cryer, and his ten-year-old son, Angus T. Jones. While Sheen does warm up to his nephew, he's doesn't turn all saccharine and start acting like an uncle should.

Instead, he's a wonderfully corrupting influence and the two of them often collude against the father. I've only seen one posting about Melanie Lynskey's brilliant turn as the female stalker who is always looking through Charlie's deck door. It's about as funny a regular gag as Carlton the doorman on the old Rhoda show and Candace Bergin's endless line of incompetent secretaries. She's adorable and makes the character both hilarious and creepy. Well done.

Holland Taylor is perfect as the insufferable mother both sons love to resent. Her self-involvement is hilarious. The name of the splendid comic actress playing Sheen's housekeeper is Conchata Ferrell, a veteran of TV sitcoms (Hotl Baltimore). It's wonderful to see her back in action.

Favorite episode was the return of an ex-flame of Charlie's. Only she is now a he, having had a sex-change operation. When it's discovered that ""he"" has spent the night with Charlie's mom, I could barely contain myself. I was hysterical with laughter. Then Conchata Ferrell's bit as the housekeeper who begs Charlie, offering him free housekeeping for a month, if she can be there to witness his telling his mother that the he was formerly a she! Priceless.

Wonderful cast. Wonderful, crisp writing and well-observed situations. This one has all the hallmarks of a sitcom classic and I hope it runs for years. I was never much of a Charlie Sheen admirer, but he's evolved into a first-rate comic actor and he leads this first-rate ensemble with low-key charm and expert delivery."
Killed the show,"Sep 9, 2019",8,10,3,"The show with Charlie Sheen is a strong 9/10 whereas without him, it's just meh.

They killed the show by firing him, but do yourself a favour and watch season 1-8."
10/10 up to where Charlie Sheen was,"May 30, 2024",6,2,0,"Fantastic show 10/10 up to where Charlie Sheen was, after that it's about 4/10. Really disappointed in the decision to part ways with him. Despite his behavior I feel like he was a crucial part in the charm and charisma of the show. Great combination a d dynamic with the rest of the cast (Alan, Bertha, Jake, Evelyn, girlfriends) added a pitch of humor, diversity and freshness which is really appreciated. I will not comment on the show after that since it will be mostly negative reviews about the plot, character development and energy mismatching. Thank you tremendously for the first 6 seasons."
Charlie sheen,"Sep 9, 2012",10,8,2,"Aston kutcher instead of Charlie sheen? are we serious???? come on men,Charlie is born for comedy shows and especially for this show,he was talented and because of his real life was as the show,drinking,women and drugs,he was very good in this role in the show,but they stopped him...because he was a bad person to see on TVs..come guys,when do we live,at 1960 with full of censorship??

however,i want to be kind but Aston is awful..

This show is great,has a lot of fun but with Charlie had incredibly good jokes..

so,the result is: "" WE WANT CHARLIE BACK!!! ""

i hope that someone will read it and he will put him back..

(i am so sanguine , ha ha)"
The leading role was meant for Charlie Sheen,"May 16, 2022",7,2,0,"As long as Charlie is there, its hilarious! After the 8th season, don't bother. Sheen was right about the writers all along. Even wasted, he is comedy gold."
A Delightful Comic Serial,"Oct 5, 2007",10,45,30,"Here is a show that always brings a smile on my face. That's a guarantee.Two brothers,so very different in personalities,a mother delightfully self-centred,a little boy,cool and collected,a no nonsense housekeeper and the odd Rose who appears from the wainscoting-almost! The script is so good and delivered perfectly by all the actors.Charlie Sheen's casual spaced out persona brings out exactly who he is.A job most well done. Jon Cryer is just too good an actor.Excellent expression of a harassed,exasperated and slightly neurotic character often at sea as to how to deal with a bright son who now and then pairs up with his Uncle.And such talent in the little guy-Angus T. Jones. I always look forward to the appearance of the Mother and the Housekeeper.They are always so good.But my special favourite is Rose, enacted by the talented Melanie Lynskey.How subtly she brings out her obsessive and yet cute self.She is the right gal for Charlie's character, sweet,funny and crazy."
Hollywood doesn't know when to stop,"Apr 22, 2018",6,2,0,"'You don't eat soup after you've had dinner' is basically what defines this show. It was full of fun and colors when Charlie Sheen was part of it. Jokes were actually funny and the chemistry between the brothers, nephew and their mom were on spot. Not an episode went by where I haven't laughed. After kicking off Charlie Sheen, they continued on with new cast, a.k.a Ashton Kutcher, who brought this show to it's knees. The jokes weren't moderately funny, I couldn't make it through season 9 and had to give up.Producers definitely were money hungry, else they wouldn't have continued this show after Sheen's departure."
just unfunny,"Mar 9, 2012",1,16,4,i used to love this show when i was younger but i came to the realisation that two and a half men i just stupidity personified who would watch this other than to pass the time the kid is fat and unintelligent the father has got to be gay or at least bi with his mannerisms. Now for charlie harper or sheen he was great in ferris beullers day off but when he is playing an exaggerated version of himself its just not funny. Now for the thing that annoys me mist about two and a half men the laugh track is just over used its used for like every 15 seconds and its just innuendos i love innuendos but its just used in every scene in every line its stupid the whole programme is stupid
Charlie Sheen. Yes... Ashton Kutcher. No,"Mar 2, 2019",8,6,1,"Charlie Sheen makes this show. And without him, it just doesn't work. I like Ashton Kutcher but he just doesn't work with this show. This show is Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen"
Do they have enough actors in America?,"Mar 28, 2022",7,2,0,"Have you noticed that many actors in this show had more than one role? They don't have enough actors in America?

For instance, Chelsea (Charlie's fiance) had a small appearance when Charlie wanted to 'apologize' to the women when Rose made a webpage about him.

Then, Herb's sister appeared later and she was Walden's wife. Or, Walden's girlfriend who went to New York to be a creator (he pretend to be a poor guy), she has already been in Charlie's bed, she was a young girl who wanted to have sex again or they to go to dance. Do they really needed to use some actors TWICE?

What to say about the show? It was great when Charlie was in it. And while his majesty Chuck Lorre had ideas. And he usually have ideas only 6 seasons. After that, his work is for the toilet. When Charlie went, the whole show was directed to only one thing: how Alan is cheap. Maybe 80% of jokes are about his struggle to stay as a freeloader.

The same lowering of the quality was in ""The big bang theory"". They didn't change the cast, but after the season 6, it was nothing but cr*p. It was so boring to watch this show for the next 6 seasons. They were all married, except Raj, but Lorrie couldn't find anything funny in all this situation. He simply loses his inspiration in the middle of his shows. It was painful to watch how Charlie is sad because Rose is going to London. That is, it was terrible. A nut job who stalked him, and he FELL IN LOVE WITH HER???!! So, so STUPID. This you have when you have a lack of ideas.

Chuck Lorrie, a master of making characters, even the cast is not wrong, but when he is drained, he is drained, the show is dead after 5 or 6 seasons. That is Chuck."
Get Charlie back!,"Jan 8, 2012",1,13,3,"First of all, my vote is for episodes which Charlie Sheen was acting (10 stars). Story, jokes and all that was good.

Now about Ashon. I watched some of his movies and they are great. However I cannot find him as good replacement for Charlie. Strange, but I don't laugh to Ashons jokes and all that nudity is really not funny at all. On top of it, I was horribly disappointed in first episode in season with Ashon. I mean they made some bad jokes about Charlie and they made impression that everybody was hating him - not cool at all.

I have been reading that Charlie was replaced because it was really ""expencive"" comparing to Ashon. I don't remember what sum was about, but difference was counting in millions. This is not excuse for me since Charlie built up Two and a Half Men and I believe that he deserves money.

In my opinion IMDb should separate voting for this show, 1 while Charlie was acting and 1 while Ashon is acting, otherwise it is not fair - reputation will go higher or lower for sure with new actor."
Funniest Show on TV,"Mar 6, 2006",N/A,206,117,"This show has more laughs per minute than any other sit com. I have not laughed as often or as intensely because of any TV show in decades. The casting and acting is superb and the writing creative and hilarious. If you don't laugh at this show, sell your television and see a doctor, because something ain't right. The characters are diverse and quirky, the subjects always seem to push the limits without offending, and I only wish the show was on more than once a week. It's the kind of show where the actors must go home, collect their checks and wonder why they are paid so much for doing something they enjoy so much. I envy them, we should all be so fortunate in doing something that brings this level of humor into the lives of others. For this I extend my sincere appreciation to the cast, writers, directors and producers."
"First 8, rest is disaster","Sep 26, 2020",8,6,1,"First 8 seasons with Charlie are really great, funny. Rest of the show is disaster"
A great comedy gala turning into another average TV Show,"Oct 21, 2012",6,4,2,"I previously voted this show 10/10. I was a huge fan of this show. I loved the chemistry between the brothers and the kid. There was a unique kind of emotions between all the characters. There was Charlie who always says that Alan has to leave his house, but internally he does not wants him to leave. There was Alan who knew that he is being a ""parasitic leech"" but took it as his birthright to live with his brother. There was Jake who was only there to display his stupidity. Charlie and Alan although used to fight, but they needed each other to fight, just like Tom and Jerry, and that was the most hilarious part of the show.

Now apart from Jake everything is changed. There is Alan now whose most of the time is spent in making sure he remains in the house. Charlie was evil and funny. Walden is kind, rich and trying to be funny. Walden and Alan do not fight. They are friends, sometimes kinda gay. The show has taken an entire strange turn. Its not funny anymore. Its more of a chewing gum now, there was taste, but not anymore. But you don't wanna throw it thinking of the great taste it gave."
It started out funny but....,"May 27, 2008",7,4,3,"This may contain spoilers...

It started out funny but it is starting to get old. It seems like every episode is the same storyline as every other episode. Charlie tries to have sex with a woman or has sex with a woman then never calls her again. Alan either meets a really sophisticated woman or mopes around and complains about his life. Alan and Charlie's mom is always up to something no good and never has anything good about them and Charlie and Alan try to avoid her at all costs. The only two characters who make the show really funny with their funny jokes is Berta the maid and Alan's son Jake. I would recommend the earlier episodes of this show otherwise it gets old really fast."
A Definite 10 ....... TILL CHARLIE LEFT!,"Aug 18, 2019",10,11,4,This Show was a Definite 10 for Eight Seasons until they left Charlie go. At that Point it Dropped to a 1 at best and should have been Cancelled. Might have been a Bit better post Charlie Show if they had Judith Divorce her Doctor husband and he had joined Alan because they were Both at least Funny. Kushner destroyed all of the chemistry on the show.
Extremely funny!,"May 31, 2005",7,9,12,"Amazingly funny sitcom with Charlie Sheen in the leading role as a single guy living with his divorced brother and 10 years old nephew. Charlie Sheen always plays the same guy in sitcoms, he's always Charlie, always himself, a guy who can't grow up, find a girlfriend (and not for just one night), stay with her, marry her and settle. I loved him in ""Spin City"" as well, more than Michael J. Fox although he was quit good as well.

Charlie Sheen really deserved his Golden Globe nomination for ""Two and a Half Men"". With this comic sitcom I just can't stop laughing. The humour really works, the jokes and situations really are funny, the characters are amusing: everything is perfect.

I hope this sitcom will last a long time and won't be cancelled after a couple of seasons. I've seen many comical shows like ""That 70's show"", ""Will & Grace"", ""My Wife and kids"" (not that funny actually), ""Two Guys, a girl and a pizza place"",... I think together with ""Two guys, a girl and a pizza place"", this might be the most funny one.

See it! Hilarious!"
"With Charlie 10 stars, 0 stars without him","Dec 11, 2019",5,8,1,"The show should have ended with Charlie's departure. I watched first 8 season so many times...the show is so funny and timeless, but I couldn't watch the rest of the show not even once."
Overrated Sitcom That Is Funny But Goes Nowhere,"Aug 21, 2007",6,5,6,"Chuck Lorre is in my opinion a pretty funny writer i was so so with Dharma and Greg, hated Roseanne, and once again i'm so so with Two and A Half Men. It seems though that Lorre is one of those guys that get better and better as they go so i'm looking very forward to The Big Bang Theory this fall on CBS. Now on to the sitcom everyone is hailing as the only worthwhile sitcom on TV for one that is a terrible terrible lie. Two and a Half Men is funny i enjoy it's sexual, crude, but intelligent humour but the show is extremely over rated. The characters do not develop or change or learn lessons and all the show plot wise goes absolutely nowhere every episode is funny but character wise uninteresting. Why Charlie Sheen is viewed as the star is beyond me and why he's up for an emmy is beyond the world because any true fan of the show should be well aware that Jon Cryer is the star. He's definitely the person who generates the best jokes and delivers his lines best he's also the only character who is eccentric or different while the others are very laid back and casual. Charlie Sheen basically just says his lines and he's lucky that they're very good lines or else the show wouldn't be funny. The show is quite entertaining and because of it's go nowhere characters can go on for a long time. Two and a Half Men is really just a bunch of good writers speaking through actors there really isn't anything that makes the characters three dimensional other than Jon Cryer and the boys's mom. From the beginning the show has pretty much only furthered the Alan and his ex wife plot line and not very far at all. I do enjoy the show and find it funny it has it's few classic episodes bu it's never had a ""bad"" episode at least so far and probably because the series is so ho hum that you're expectations aren't big going into it. I think it's one of the most over rated sitcoms in terms of it's constant emmy nominations but it is a huge and hilarious stepping stone for Chuck Lorre who get's better and better as he goes. Overall it's a good show to watch when not much else is on but you won't miss anything if you don't watch it for weeks."
Baffling,"Feb 16, 2011",1,28,12,"Clearly I'm missing something here; this programme is constantly being billed as ""America's most popular comedy"" and it has a fairly high rating on here, but I just can't stand it. It's not funny. I think that my main issue with it is that none of the characters are in any way likable.

We have Charlie Sheen playing what is essentially an over-exaggerated version of himself: an alcoholic, millionaire sex-maniac who, in my opinion, comes across as a borderline rapist - I mean, he's often getting women inebriated in order to have sex with them, OK - it's a comedy, it's not meant to be taken seriously, but it seems extremely sinister.

Then there's his brother, a man who is equally sex-obsessed, but just doesn't seem to receive as much of it, and who lives off his brother like some kind of parasite. He has a son; a greedy, chubby, intellectually subnormal adolescent, and a vile ex-wife. There is also the ghastly mother of the two brothers, and a loudmouthed maid.

The characters all behave towards each other in an almost sociopathic way - even they can't seem to stand each other and communicate though insulting one-liners. Again, I understand that it's a comedy and shouldn't be taken seriously, but there's something inherently depressing about the dynamic and relationship between the characters. I find it difficult to enjoy or find humour in something that is made up of such unpleasant individuals.

That aside, I'm surprised that people haven't got tired of the humour in this programme, it's entirely based around three main themes: sex jokes, fart/bowel movement jokes, and ""ha ha the kid is so stoopid, tee hee hee"" jokes.

One more thing - the series also contains constant references to the baffling observation that drinking coffee makes you s!!t. I've never heard this anywhere outside of Two and a Half Men, and they mention it all the time. Maybe I'm missing something, but I just do not like it."
The show is dead - CBS resurrected it as a zombie,"Oct 8, 2011",N/A,29,11,"I watched 2 episodes of the 9th season - it's not funny anymore. This show was my favorite for years and now such a disappointment. When I heard CBS decided to continue the show with Kutcher instead of Charlie - I told: OK, I like Charlie's character and can't imagine the show w/o him but let give the guys a shot. But Kutcher absolutely doesn't match his role. He is a good actor but just not for the show. The 9th season should never be started. After the 16 episodes of 8th season, CBS should produce only one episode 9x01, call it 8x17 and end the show. That would be a good end for the show. Now, it's just a zombie. And all of this just because of the guy who is ashame of his real name... He should just name Charlie ""Carlos"" and get them even. Probably, the Chuck creates good ideas/scripts but Charlie provided energy for the show. He was a soul of the show. As I said: a body w/o a soul is a zombie."
"the funniest show on television, bar none!!!","Oct 6, 2005",8,62,51,"I cannot get enough of this show. I laugh out loud through the entire episode, EVERY WEEK. The entire cast is hilarious. It is difficult to choose who is the funniest. In the season opener, I feel that Angus really out shined everyone else. His timing was impeccable. And, Jon Cryer with the girl's mother in the principal's office, I laughed so hard, I started crying. I hope that this program runs for many years, until Jake goes to college. We don't see enough of him, though and I know that is because of his age. The women are also awesome. The next to the last or last episode this past season was priceless with Holland Taylor being drenched because Jake left the bathtub running. If you haven't watched this show, don't miss it next week. I guarantee you will laugh a lot!!!"
Funny man show,"Aug 20, 2022",7,2,1,I grew up with 2 and a 1/2 men and Even though I like Charlie Sheen I thought it was still watchable when they found Ashton Kutcher and John cryer They work well together Is still holds up today.
Charlie's exit should have ended this show,"Oct 14, 2019",9,10,4,After Charlie Sheen's exit this show should have ended. The constant bickering of the brothers and Alan being such a loser and Jake's and Elderidge's stupidity were really funny.
Great until... 3 things happened,"Aug 18, 2021",7,2,1,"Like i was saying, the show was pretty great up until 3 things happened: 1. Obviously, Charlie left the show. It wasn't a deal breaker for me at this point, i found Alan the soul of the show and Ashton was pretty ok... They had some chemistry, show was still watchable.

2. They brought in the so called Charlies' daughter, my god, what a cringe fest. She was bad and the writing for her was even worse.

3. The little black kid they suposedly adopted... wow, that, for me was the last clown in the circus. Everything after this was just hard to watch, even the actors had those ""kill me now"" faces. I'm glad they shut it down.

So to sum up, they kinda tried to fill the gaps left by Charlie and Jake, but failed miserably."
"No Charlie, No Show!","Oct 18, 2011",9,11,5,"I'm looking forward to the 'powers that be' realising their mistake, killing off Kutcher's character ""Walden"", slamming Sheen into an iron-clad rehab programme before bringing him back as a ghost that haunts the house Alan's inherited from Walden in Malibu. Or something similar. Maybe Walden goes Buddhist and gets reincarnated by Charlie.

ANYTHING as long as Sheen replaces Kutcher or at least reappears regularly. Forgive me, but Ashton Kutcher in this format can ONLY appeal to slightly retarded teenage girls - and no-one else. And what the hell is up with underusing Jake in this new series?? Do the creators/producers/notwork remember even WHY the show is called what it is?! Even the worst episode with Sheen was better than the best one with Kutcher.

Luckily, I have the entire old series on DVD coz this one blows monolithic chunks.

where do i begin?,"Jun 25, 2012",1,18,7,"This show used to be funny. With Charlie Sheen I would give this show a ten out of ten. For anyone who didn't watch it before they killed off Charlie and replaced him with a moron (Kutcher) it was a fantastic show. Now its ridiculous! I have seen a couple episodes and all it was was really bad toilet humor and gay jokes. Jon Cryer's character has become an even more leach than before and he is incredibly annoying! Kutcher as internet billionaire moron is well very very sad. Kutcher CANT ACT! I have no idea why people even hire him for roles! The show that made me laugh now makes me cringe! I say stop watching this show and tune in for Charlie's new show ''Anger Management'' we all know Charlie made the show, Chuck Lorre should admit it and put Two and a Half Men where it belongs, in a casket and six feet under."
Hilarious just got boring.,"Sep 11, 2012",7,1,0,"Ashton Kutcher performance has been decent. He is the perfect choice for the role he represents but the script has been awful. Season 9 was a let down, what was usually a can't stop laughing the whole episode series turn into to one or two episodes with good jokes and a the rest just awful and completely boring. After Charlie Sheen's removal the series didn't start up to a good start.First of all the funniest man got fired and John Cryer isn't the real reason the show survived all 8 years. Angus T. Jones is funny but lately hasn't been used much on the show. He is the person who can make the show brighten up again, he is technically the secret weapon... But until the writers and producers, specially Chuck Lore, wakes up the show will continue to be boring!"
This show has officially gone down the tubes!,"Mar 12, 2012",1,11,3,"Two and a Half Men has gone from being one of the best sitcoms on T.V. to one of the worst, which is quite an accomplishment considering how truly awful 90% of the sitcoms are these days. It was a great show with Charlie Sheen because he WAS the show! Maybe the ratings are still good, but that just shows you how clueless its current fans are. Ashton Kutcher is absolutely one of the worst actors of all time, both in movies and television. He was O.K. in That 70's Show, and a little less O.K. in Dude, Where's My Car? (basically the same character), but everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, he has done since has been atrocious. Punk'd is unwatchable, a third-rate Candid Camera rip-off. The fact that he is considered a success in Hollywood shows you how low our standards have sunk. If you have model looks you can go way further than your questionable talent would otherwise take you. And Angus T. Jones was all right when he was a cute little kid, but age has not treated him well. It will be a miracle if he does anything else watchable. Jon Cryer and the other actors in the series are good, but they need to look for other vehicles for their talent. Charlie Sheen's talent made their stars shine brighter in the series. Ashton Kutcher's lack of talent will drag them down into his whirlpool of mediocrity."
"Is there really a point in replacing a lead character, rather than cancel the show?","Oct 19, 2011",N/A,12,4,"It's not that Ashton Kutcher isn't funny here, but he's no Charlie Sheen. I don't see the point of going on without him. The show has basically run its course anyway. In a TV series, replacing a supporting character is one thing, but if a show doesn't have its star anymore, why bother going on? Maybe losing Sheen wouldn't seem so offensive if the show had left too. Even if he were still on the show, this would have been the final season anyway. So I'd be surprised if this lasted another season. I also think Sheen should at least have been allowed back for a cameo, or even a voice-over (such as on a telephone). Just because a show has stellar ratings, doesn't mean it has to stay on, or does it? There have been shows cancelled in spite of good ratings, which means there are other reasons for cancellations."
Two and a Half men (until season 8),"Feb 8, 2023",8,3,0,"In my opinion, the show died in season 8 so I'm rating this show without counting the last seasons with Ashton Kutcher. This show is one of the best sitcoms, the chemistry between Alan and Charlie is amazing making them a great duo when they cooperate and they just argue with each other and fight. Also Jake the son of Alan was very enjoyable, but after some seasons I didn't find any true development on the character until he started appearing less less. After season 8 the show just gave up. I didnt like the way they managed Charlie's sheen quit of the show making it obvious it was a last chance save of the series."
A sexist but good comedy,"Jul 17, 2022",7,1,0,"Series in which two very different brothers coexist. The first is a bachelor always in search of new conquests, the second is divorced and with a dependent child. The plots of the essential episodes revolve around how bad one is while the other wins over a different woman in each episode just to have a fleeting relationship. The series is fun but slightly sexist.

Everything changes when Charlie dies. No i'm kidding, nothing changes. Same humor, same plots, same actors or almost."
A Legend that will be Remembered,"Feb 16, 2016",10,3,0,"As one of the most controversial sit-coms ever created Two and a Half Men ran for 12 years between 2003 and 2015. It was one of TV's biggest sit-coms, always high in the ratings and, especially in it's later years, causing a stir in the world of show-biz.

First of all though, Two and a Half Men used a lot of humour that was very much in the viewers face and not afraid to be undisciplined. This led to a lot of people describing the show as misogynistic and creepy, but the diverse mix of personalities in the cast make for a lot of very fun scenes and great comedy.

There's plenty of tone shifts throughout the series, in the early series (series 1-3 but Series 1 in particular) there's a sense of warmth in the family dynamic and a real sense of friendship between the actors which shines out of the screen.

However around the Series 4 mark, things get a little darker. The writing between the characters becomes a little more hostile. It's never to the point of evil but there's something darker in the tone.

Then Series 7 become a lot darker where the hostility between the characters appears to turn into hate in certain episodes and they can't seem to go a scene without insulting each other. The writing also becomes darker at this point and can even alienate me at points, and I've loved this show for years.

Then, along with the cast change in Series 9, everything became a little warmer, with a new dynamic and a new friendship between the cast.

The quality of the series always held up and no matter what episode you picked, you were guaranteed a laugh, and you're guaranteed to see the great characters shine out of the screen, then along came Series 9, and everything fell apart.

Ashton Kutcher just isn't a good enough actor to carry a show like this, and the character of Walden is so thin and uninteresting that there's nothing for the writers to work with and the humour falls flat.

This is a problem carried over from the later Sheen years, where characters are there but not really interesting and don't get involved enough with the humour of the episode. Walden just embodies this problem because no matter what the episode is, NO-ONE CARES!

Alan turns into a complete victim in this series, and becomes double the loser he was in the previous series. Also the new beach house design is revolting. It's so awkwardly modern, there's ipads on the walls, ornaments in the shape of '@' signs, cushions that look like keyboard buttons, it's so awkward and nasty to look at.

Jake is the same but he vanishes in Series 10 and doesn't return until the series finale, in which he is replaced by Jenny, Charlie's long-lost illegitimate lesbian daughter, who is almost exactly like Charlie except, she's a woman, and she was obviously only brought in to bring some of that classic Charlie humour back to the series. Does it work? No!

All the other characters are pathetic, and the characters we all know and love from the Sheen years disappear from the series, whatever happened to Evelyn, Judith, Herb, Rose, Berta, Gorden, they all seen to either disappear completely, or gradually leave the series.

I did try not to make this a complete rant on the final four years of Two and a Half Men, but they were so awful I couldn't resist. There's so much I haven't covered but I haven't got the word space so I'll sum up.

Two and a Half Men will be remembered for years to come, people will remember it because it was the reason the Big Bang Theory, Mike and Molly and Mom were all made, three hugely successful sit-coms under the control of Chuck Lorre.

Even though the final four years were not of high quality, I will miss this show. It made me laugh for 8 years and gave me something to rant about for another 4. It's still a great show that has already left it's mark on American TV, and even though I live in the UK, you could feel the ripples of the show even here. Charlie Sheen's meltdown and dismissal was all over the place here, and ratings for the show are still high for repeats. It will be remembered all over the world, and will be missed for a long time!"
This is the score for the Charlie era (seasons 1-8),"Dec 13, 2014",6,0,0,"I know a lot of people are using pretty strong language on this forum about how the show sucked after Charlie was kicked off, but I really just wanna say... it wasn't that good to start with either.

The characters were inconsistent, the stories were unconvincing, and the humor at sometimes were really kinda sick. I know it's not very fair to criticize a sitcom of not being very logical and realistic, but 2 and a half men sometimes really stretches things a bit too far and make you wonder about the producer's personalities.

Let's start with the characters. Charlie Harper is this lucky bastard who is a total jerk to all people around him. He lives an incredibly unhealthy lifestyle, doesn't give a damn about anything that he should, and is just unfairly rich. He's the man that everybody loves to hate: gets everything in life easy but doesn't deserve a single bit of that status.

Alan Harper is a chiropractor, a profession that is supposed to make 100k+ annually, who is unbelievably cheap after being divorced by his ex-wife. He's also incredibly awkward in all situations and has the worst luck with women. The show tries to make him a poor pathetic little nerd with a life so miserable it's borderline worthy of committing suicide.

Jake Harper started off as a kid that was somewhat smart, though usually being considered as stupid. Charlie found the kid amusing so he took Jake and Alan in. However, that only lasted for a very short fleet, and I guess the producers just thought that it's way easier writing a stupid kid than a kid with okay gifts that just wasn't interested in exploiting his talents.

So the center of this show is pretty much trying to make fun out of the contrast between Charlie and Alan, how Charlie so successfully abuse the women in his orbit, how extremely unlucky and pathetic Alan is, and how stupid Jake is. The humor here is pretty evil. It's basically built on all the worst things in life, and making jokes out of people. Yeah I laughed some times, but do you really consider stuff like Alan taking the medical exam that gave him so many health problems good humor?

And let's look at the female non-leads. Rose, the crazy stalker with no boundaries and serious mental problems that Charlie never appreciated until, well, you know.

Judith, Alan's ex-wife who divorced him to be a lesbian, but later adjusted to a ""typical"" wife that became strict and annoying and demanding and uninterested in sex right after marriage.

Evelyn, the un-motherly mother who would put sex and money before her children in a heartbeat, and doesn't get any appreciation from her children (or grandchildren) despite the help that she does provide them.

Berta, the very unattractive maid who has no work ethic and a strong attitude and very often disrespects her employers. She also has a really really messed up family that produces loads of cheap slutty daughters.

Aside from Berta who has a Garfield-like attitude who could actually be funny without being offending and making viewers uncomfortable, most of these women are just very, very messed up. I get it that everyday life is boring and almost no sitcoms are remotely realistic, but the theme of ""we're terrible people, now laugh"" gets pretty unfunny after a while. Wait... why did I dis-include Berta in this category anyway? Alright let me say this in another way, of all these characters, Berta's character seems to be the only one not viewer-offensive to me. That's probably not that nice.

Then there were the girls like Mia and Chelsie who were pretty much bimbos that Charlie just happened to actually like. I really can't remember much about these women now, they were way too normal so the part with low credibility was more on how Charlie landed such wonderful women and why would Charlie want to have a serious relationship and settle.

So all in all, I know that people blame this show for killing off Charlie. I still have yet to watch the episodes of the show in the post-Charlie era, but seriously, I don't think the Charlie Sheen era was that perfect anyway.

UPDATE:

Okay so I just watched through over half of the episodes after the switch from Charlie to Walden and I have to say, I understand the rant now. The humor is very low, and they are turning all the characters into unlikable bitches. eg. Alan's basically a leech now. It was barely tolerable when he was Charlie's brother, but after Charlie died, the only (marginally) reasonable thing to do for him was to move in with his mother. The show should have cancelled long ago when Charlie and Augus left. Now this show is just very pathetic."
I hate everything after season 8,"Oct 10, 2019",9,3,0,"Okay I know I am waaaaay to late. I never brought myself to it to watch this show. But when I started I laughed my ass of! I loved it and I couldn't wait to continue watching this show after work! But then THE scene comes on... At first I thought it was jet another joke from Charlie that he 'died'. But then after watching 2½ Episodes from Season 9, I realoged that this was deffinetly not a Joke. I literally felt how my body begann to tingle. Like the tingle that is like ""oh... Wait... Is it real? No... Oh my god..."" and so on. And I imediantly skilled a few Episode s to see if it is realy what I thought and it was. Now I've watched every Episode from season 1-8 and 2 ½ Episode s from season 9 and I do not want to watch it anymore... Sorry"
Ruined,"Jul 28, 2022",6,1,0,I would have given it 10/10 the shaw should have ended when charlie sheen was dropped! It was my favourite comedy show until the ruined it with Ashton kutcher.
Like everyone is saying the show was much better than with ashton,"Aug 8, 2023",3,4,0,After watching the rest of the sitcom after they kicked Charlie i feel like countless hours were stolen from me hoping the show would get better but obviously not the show got worse way worse they kept getting walden into relationships and breaking him over stupid things and forcing action into the sitcom with him marrying allen and getting them a child ? That was one of the dumbest things or maybe the dumbest plot twist i ever watched let's just say it's tied with the worst final episode where it seems like they were making fun of Charlie and mocking him maybe even bullying him over his substance problem.
TEN,"Jul 8, 2020",10,3,0,"This is the best comedy show and I can defend my statement. From the very beginning the writers didn't limit their jokes, the boundaries were all over the place(if there were any at all), the delivery was almost always on point, rarely lame, the acting was as if the actors were, in fact, their characters in life(not just Charlie). It looked so realistic, and yet kind of too much at the same time. There's reraly any mainstream(boring) humor. The jokes are controversial and unusual. People often critique Jake (and the writers) for becoming dumb, but growing in that environment what would one expect? A father with his own moral compass(which often times wasn't correct) , money issues, and too much caring about what other people think of him; un uncle who is a whoremonger and is always with alcohol, cigar or ..something else in his mouth; a mother who apparently didn't care much for her husband and uses him after the divorce for her own needs; a grandmother who has probably killed a couple of husbands and was a terrible mother to her children. It was just circumstantial that Jake became dumber with the series progress. It's a perfect mix between funny for grown ups, funny for not so grown ups, kind of vulgar..sometimes, sexy show. The acting is superb, the directing too. I like how the humor is of all kinds, and all over the place(its spectrum is wide)."
Not the same without Charlie.,"May 10, 2022",7,1,0,"Charlie left and I never watched after that. Nothing else to say.

Still it requires 150 characters, so let me say this: it was a good show, not great but fun and suitable to relax while watching. It was different. It was cool because of the synergy between characters. The best gone - no show."
Charlie Sheen made this,"Oct 31, 2011",4,12,4,"Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen is was, if not, the funniest sitcom on TV, and easily one of the best ever made. Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer together was a match made in sitcom heaven, whilst Angus also added a lot, especially when he was a child.

Ever since they thought it was necessary and they could not forgive him, they got rid of Charlie Sheen and completely ruined the show. Ashton Kutcher isn't a good actor, hes mediocre at best and plays the role bad. He isn't no Charlie Sheen, and it shows. Ever since Sheen left, they have been trying to bring in jokes, that just don't work without his dry and sarcastic humour, Kutcher isn't of the same acting pedigree of Sheen."
Really funny,"Jan 7, 2005",N/A,80,58,"This is the only sitcom I make an effort to watch! I drive my son nuts when he hears me laughing out loud, by myself in front of the TV! This show is fast and smart. Being the mother of three grown men, the relationship with their Mom is great! I enjoy all the characters, the housekeeper is wonderful asset to the show with some of the best lines. The actor who plays the boy is also excellent, and I am not a lover of child actors, but this kid just hits the mark and is very realistic. Of course Charlie Sheen when he has a part that laughs at himself is superb! John Cryer as his brother is also perfect. The ditsy neighbor is a bit of a stretch, but seems to fill a vacant spot (no pun meant) As I have said this is the one sitcom I look forward to watching. 5/10/05 Now son has finally started watching and has to admit it is a funny program....."
Seasons 1 - 8 are absolutely hilarious and excellent but the show was destroyed and ruined by Ashton Kutcher,"May 31, 2019",10,5,1,"Two and a Half Men is an absolutely hilarious sitcom and I watch the repeats of Seasons 1 - 8 with Charlie Sheen in it on TV and absolutely love the sitcom. When Charlie Sheen was fired from the show and when they put Ashton Kutcher in it as Walden, the show was destroyed and ruined by the awful Ashton Kutcher. Ashton Kutcher is an absolutely lame, useless and crap actor and his acting as Walden was rubbish and boring which made the sitcom boring when Charlie Sheen was not in it. The chemistry between Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer was absolutely amazing and brilliant and his interaction with the other characters such as Jake (played by Angus T. Jones), Berta (played by Conchata Ferrell), Herb Melnick (played by Ryan Stiles), Evelyn Harper (played by Holland Taylor), Rose (played by Melanie Lynskey), Chelsea (played by Jennifer Taylor) etc was also amazing and brilliant. Ashton Kutcher had none of these strengths, he made the series boring from Season 9 onwards and I stopped watching the show, but I do watch the repeats with Charlie Sheen in it. When i watched the show and when i also watch the repeats with Charlie Sheen in it, I just crack up laughing at Charlie Sheen so much and found it very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Jon Cryers acting as Alan Harper was also excellent, he also made me laugh and i also used to crack up laughing at Alan."
Going down fast,"Apr 9, 2022",6,1,0,"OK, this show is not going to increase your intelligence or help you gain much knowledge in basically anything. Nevertheless, it is funny, uncomplicated and it is good to just relax and chill. Unfortunately, the show went down fast after switching from Charlie Sheen to Ashton Kutcher. Not saying AK is not good but once you've gotten used to the original setup and characters... it just doesn't work for me. Also, Alan's character gets exaggerated to the point of sad ridiculousness. The further addition of new (pretty bad) characters render it unwatchable. How it was on the air for around 12 years, I have no idea."
Fabulous and Funny Show with Charlie Sheen,"Apr 8, 2020",10,5,1,Two and a Half Men was hilarious and must see TV when Charlie Sheen was on the show. They should have over looked their differences and paid him whatever he wanted to stay on this show. It was horrible with Ashton Kutcher.

Without Charlie Sheen the show dies!,"Mar 17, 2011",10,9,4,"I give this show a 10. Up until now.

This show without Charlie Sheen is nothing! I will stop watching this show the second another actor takes Charlie Sheens place or when the let Charlies character die.

This guy Chuck Lorre and the people at the production company are not smart, when they let the star go. I mean the guy is finally well, and they reply with stopping to shoot the show. Disgrace! I am in Sweden, right now, Two and a half men is on everyday. And i love every second of it. The Characters are perfect, Charlie, Alan, Jake, Berta, Rose, Herb, Evelyn and Judith. They are so awesome. Funny, witty, i mean Jake is so hilarious, and Alan, i laugh every time he does an ""alan"" thing. Like with Chelseas friend from College. Such a funny show. I hope the people in charge come to their senses and realize they have to kill the show if it is without Charlie Sheen!"
first 8 season is good,"Jun 15, 2021",7,0,0,"When Charlie died, the series died.

I only stopped at season 8."
Two and a Half original jokes per season.,"Apr 17, 2008",5,24,12,"Imagine a day you've probably had. A day that wasn't that bad, but it was probably a regular work day. Nothing big happened, but it wasn't a particularly slow work day. You saw people that you normally see every day, but you didn't do anything all that special with them. You might have gotten a headache, but it wasn't that bad. You didn't really eat anything all that delicious. Just a normal, forgettable day.

Imagine every day of your life going that way.

Two and a half men would be the only show on television in that world.

Charlie Sheen is not the world's greatest actor or comedian, but he can do better than this. This show is only vaguely better than the average sitcom, and the sitcom, on average, is often lacking. Sure, it's a limited medium, but knowing that, it leads us to expect more from the effort that goes into making a sitcom.

2 1/2 Men does illustrate a change in shift of what sitcoms can be when viewed against...I don't know...10 years ago? But it doesn't take it any further than that. I just rests comfortably on its ability to do things that are ""new"" and ""edgy"", but it doesn't make any effort to be a part of any stride towards new ideas. It's riding the coattails of shows that laid the groundwork. It's more contemporary than Seinfeld, but it is way behind Seinfeld in it how original it is.

I've seen a lot of comments that rate this show rather highly. Come on, folks, expect more.

True, shows like Arrested Development often meet an untimely end (and yes, you can take that as my endorsement of Arrested Development as a watermark standard of what a good sitcom can be), but then again, look at Spin City. That wasn't one of the greatest sitcoms ever, but it was well above average, and it had a fair run. You can at least hope for that.

And sure, you kind of have to go with what's available, but you don't have to totally lower your standards just because almost everything on TV sucks right now.

2 1/2 men is just flat. I know, I know. It really should be good, and the powers involved (Charlie Sheen, the writers, the director and the producers) aren't evil for forcing this on us (though hardly benevolent), but come on...TV can do better than this.

5 stars is almost too nice, but less than 3 would be a little too mean...a little.

The shortcomings of this show don't offend me, but they do really disappoint me."
Hit and miss,"Apr 30, 2007",8,16,12,"Don't get me wrong, i do like this sitcom, it's very witty and intelligent but it's started to go downhill for me.

I watched every episode from the first and second series and really enjoyed it. I loved the idea in the beginning about Alan getting divorced and having to move himself and his ten year old son, Jake into his waste of space brother Charlie's apartment.

Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen)is a funny character, i love it when he writes his jingles and his and Jake's scenes are some of the best in the programme. Alan (Jon Cryer) started off OK, but now i find him annoying. I used to love the exploration of the brother relationship but now it all seems to be about Charie's sex life and Jake isn't in it as much as he used to be.

I love Charlie and Alan's mother, Evelyn and i think Rose is very funny when she is obsessed with Charlie, but Judith is a little dull. One of the best characters has to be Charlie's housekeeper, Berta. She is so dry and cynical and makes me laugh all the time, she could say anything to Charlie and he'd never fire her! Jake is played brilliantly by Angus t. Jones and the show wouldn't be the same without him. The way he bonds with 'uncle Charlie' is very well written, Alan always seems to be jealous.

I think they've lost a certain spark that they had at the beginning when having a family was all new to Charlie and being single was all new to Alan and Jake just didn't care.

Worth watching though, very good."
Overstayed it's welcome,"May 13, 2022",7,1,0,"I have to admit I never really liked the show on my first couple of tries but after a while it becomes really addictive.

With Charlie Sheen: The show is fun. The mix of Charlie and Alan is really balanced. They have fun and along with Jake - who plays the dimwitted son very well - there's always something new and fun to look forward to. The evolution of Charlie is also interesting. Going from being a male who*e to looking for something more deep and meaningful is actually quite entertaining. His mom is also an excellent dynamic to the show. All in all it's good fun. I give this part of the show a 9.

Post Charlie Sheen: What a mess. It difficult to watch sometimes and has the remnants of a show that's just tanking while executives scramble to bring in the paramedics to try squeeze out another episode.

Firstly Alan's personality is abysmal. His care free attitude and plain stupidness bares no resemblance to the uptight douchebag that made us laugh in the first 9 seasons. The oblivion between what's funny and what's not is so unbareably cringy and so out of reach you'd need to look through a telescope just to find the line.

Lyndsey and her incomprehensible personality is as close to bi-polar as possible. He burns her house down she still loves him, she's cheating on him breaks up with him to date someone else and then cheats on that guy with Alan. A simple plot of her character falling off the cliff would have been funnier.

Then there's the addition of Charlie's daughter that to me was just the tipping point. Trying to recreate Charlie Sheen in female form to cater to the demographics is as bad as taking your pet snail to France. Just don't do it.

Finally Ashton Kutcher. To me he doesn't even make his stamp on the show. He does that whole teenage cute guy act which might have worked on the 70s show but just really makes you want to punch his face out in this.

All in all I'd give the show a 4 for seasons 9 to 12."
"Fun, well-crafted show.. uncertain future.","Apr 12, 2004",N/A,79,60,"This show is really fun to watch. I can't tell who's better - the writers or the actors. The writing is great - tight and witty with plenty of sarcasm. The actors are very talented and work incredibly well with each other. You can tell they have a lot of fun together and it's fun to watch.

On some shows, if the writers have an ""off"" day, the whole episode is subpar. The same with any of the actors. But in the case of this show, I think if anyone has an ""off"" day, the rest of the ensemble could carry the show brilliantly.

If the chemistry and writing stay at current levels (or continue to get better) I can see this show winning a lot of critical acclaim. The only thing I wonder - just how much comedy can be milked out of the characters' current lives before the

writers have to start inventing bizarre plots just to get laughs?"
Something to replace the Monday Blues!,"Feb 18, 2006",8,8,4,"Actually my mother was a fan before I became one of this show. I can't wait to see it regularly in syndication. The chemistry between CHarlie Sheen and Jon Cryer is absolutely perfect. The Harper brothers are both opposites. The casting of Angus Jones as Charlie's son Jake is quite brilliant. He is so naturally funny to watch on the show. I love seeing Holland Taylor but we don't see enough of her as their domineering, critical mother who could put Marie Barone to shame. She's not that kind of mother who will bake cookies and take her grandson to the zoo. She's a more contemporary grandmother. Anyway it's great to see Conchetta Farrell as the maid, Bert. She's more than just the maid, her timing is just about perfect. I love seeing Melanie Lynskey who I didn't recognize from Heavenly Creatures as lovesick stalker of Alan Harper and neighbor. Her role of Rose is not to be ignored at all. She is quite the up and coming actress. I would have never guessed that she was a New Zealander herself. There is no trace of a Kiwi accent. The show itself has come along way from the beginning and I hope to see more in the future."

So I went back to the ""old"" show and watched again the earlier seasons.. laughed my ass off at every single episode. Despite all, Charlie really was the spice of the show. Come to think of it, I only laughed in the last season, when Alan broke everything in his body..aaaaand that was about all. I didn't even considered ""Charlie""'s reincarnation as a woman funny. I want Charlie back, he was the genuine man-whore and the only one that made me laugh, not only because he was a pig, but because the episodes when he greeted his mom with ""Good morning, Satan"" were truly funny. Without these things, the show is totally ruined from my point of view. Too bad, was one of the best comedy TV series."

Wanted to hate it after they killed Charlie,"Jan 15, 2022",7,1,0,"This show was a family favourite during Charlie's tenure. We watched it on free-to-air well before the invention of streaming services and laughed until we cried! So when they killed Charlie, I flatly refused to watch another episode.

Then streaming services were invented and more recently, lockdowns were too.

I had an opportunity to binge watch all the way through and give Walden a chance.

I have to hand it to the writers; with a little bit of suspension of disbelief, clever writing and subtle character development, they just managed to pull out of the nosedive that was Charlie Sheens disposal.

But only just.

Where Charlie was a boarish, wise-crackin', alcoholic, ladies man, Walden is a sweet natured, man-child who makes mistakes due to his ignorance (as opposed to Charlie's arrogance).

As a result, much of the friction between the two brothers that we all so came to love, practically disappears.

To ramify this, the writers have augmented the base characteristics of Alan. We all knew him to be a pathetic loser, but that was tempered by Charlie's ""Winning"" mentality.

To balance out Waldens good nature and kindness, Alan becomes even more detestable and even more unlikable;

(Repeatedley faking heart attacks, stealing quarters of Waldens dresser and basically looking for anything that will extend is already very free ride living in that house.)

It's not the formula we're used to, but the writers have done fairly well considering they lost their major draw card that was Charlie Sheen."

Season Reviewed: 2+ seasons

Bachelor, womanizer and commercial jingle writer Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen) sees his quite existence set slightly ajar when his straight-laced, now divorced brother, Alan (Jon Cryer), and 10 year old nephew, Jake (Angus T. Jones), move in. Before I begin, let me point out that my description of the show is accurate to it's attitude. That's the first sign that we're in territory that isn't entirely clichés of the standard sitcom. In another series Charlie's world would have been ""rocked"" or ""turned upside down"" with the arrival of a child. The episodes would have written themselves as the task of parental responsibility creates wackiness on autopilot that the show could have coasted on for at least a season. But 'Two and a Half Men' is such a laid back series that, much like it's comic lead, the show is more inclined to slap on a wacky Hawaiian shirt & mismatched shorts, put up it's sandal-wearing feet and shrug off these conventions as the boring trite that they are.

'Two and a Half Men' is series that centers on characters that are financially secure, generally without life's pressure and have so little to do from day-to-day that they get entangled in goofy frivolous minutia. I like this type of show. It's the epitome of simple TV escapism but without stooping to stupid 'Friends' shenanigans. 'Men' goes even beyond that. It's an unabashed superficial male fantasy where it's heroes live on the beach, drink margaritas and get to hang out with a kid and then get to shuttle him off to his real parents. The show is more concerned with getting Sheen some on screen action than it is any plot-point that goes form A to C in 30 minutes. The episodes flow along with a loose idea in them, but have more of a day-in-the-life feel. It's the type of feel that put the tombstone on the head of this year's ABC effort '10-8: Officers On Duty', but in a sitcom where nothing is at stake, it works well.

This style can be hit-or-miss for the show. It's more a playground for the actors than any storytelling device. When it's working, such as in the Prudence episode or an early episode where the brothers get drunk and spend the whole time planning to tell off their mother (Holland Taylor, 'The Practice') only to chicken out on her doorstep, 'Men' sings like a classic screwball comedy. When it isn't, there isn't a story to back it up and everything can fall apart.

Fortunately, Creator and sitcom writer-for-hire Lee Aronsohn ('Cybill') has put together a solid cast to sell this stuff. After an impressive performance taking the reins from Michael J. Fox on 'Spin City', it should have been a no-brainer to give Charlie Sheen his own series. Sheen again proves he's one of the better and more underrated comic actors on the tube. In true 'Odd Couple' style, Cryer is terrific as Sheen's uptight opposite although we don't get to see his gift for physical comedy as often as we should. The two of them could have held the show together without the insertion of young Jones. But, once again straying from convention, Jones doesn't play the insufferable ""cute kid"" role. A big grip I have about the show is the placement of the kid. There's something creepy about a 10-year-old kid put in the middle of all the sexual escapades.

I've saved the best for last. The single best and most original comedic idea contained in 'Two and a Half Men' is the character of Rose. In an all-out performance by Melanie Lynskey, Rose is a heart stealer. That great mix of funny and creepy. I can only imagine the writer's room where somebody pitched the idea that Sheen's character would have a female stalker and that she was going to be a major character. And that she would spend entire scenes standing on the deck looking through a window.

Only the Charlie Sheen Series Were Brilliantly Funny,"Jul 6, 2017",10,5,2,"Charlie Sheen Funny Aston Kutcher Not!

As others have said it just doesn't work without Charlie Sheen, it was his characters interaction with Jon Cryer, Angus T. Jones and the others that made this one of the best comedies ever made.

So .. Apart from when Charlie Sheen left I give this a 10

The writing, casting and just about everything about 2 and a half men was just brilliant. One of the few modern laugh out loud comedies where every character worked and you liked.

Some episodes and even certain scenes make me laugh over and over again, even though I know what's coming. April Bowlby as Kandi was very funny and the show would have worked better if they continued with her and Alan getting back together. Holland Taylor is perfect as Evelyn and Conchata Ferrell brilliantly funny. Jake played by Angus T. Jones is a great character, but especially in the earlier series when he was young. As he grew older the character didn't work as well in my opinion. Melanie Lynskey as Rose was an amazing character that could come out with one liners that were truly funny. Ryan Stiles Herb Melnick is so funny that a show with himself and Judith played by Marin Hinkle would have been better than the Aston Kutcher nonsense. Kelly Stables Melissa was another genius comedic character and the 'Don't give me no no' scene is still funny after seeing it many times. Martin Mull as pharmacist Russel 'What are you a cop?' was also brilliant. Funniest line ever was when Alan asks Kandi who is complaining of toothache 'when did you last see a Dentist?' to which she replied 'Alan I see people all the time, they don't always tell me what they do' Genius! So amazing series, brilliant cast and top notch writing ... Until the Aston Kutcher character comes along. Not saying it is the actors fault but I cannot even watch the post Charlie Sheen version of 2 and a half men."
Let's be honest,"Dec 27, 2018",7,2,2,"It seems that most people who review the show downvoted it after Sheen left, saying the show became s*** after that. I think that's not fair. First, I highly doubt that those people ever sat down and watched more than 1 or 2 episodes of season 9-12. Second, let's be honest: Even with Sheen, the show was already losing A LOT of quality! It started in season 3 where some episodes already felt kind of like filler. Season 4 and 5 were even worse in that matter(especially that dreadful Teddy saga and the highly overrated CSI-crossover episode!). Season 6 and 7 were slightly better, bringing back some characters or adding new ones and new scenarios(with Jake being a teen now). But it also added quite a few holes in the story/continuity.

Judith's parents: We see them in season 1. We see her mom again in season 7 and it's clearly a different actress. It's said that her husband suffered a stroke 12 years ago, yet he seemed fine in season 1. So did she btw for an alcoholic and pill-popper. Same happens with Mia's parents. How lazy is it to cast two different dad's within just 2 season?

Chelsea: We see her in the pilot. We see her as a one night stand in season 4 or 5. Then she's just written into the show without any real introduction as Charlie's new love interest. I guess I could live with all that. But then... She is engaged, yet leaves Charlie to date another guy. When it doesn't work out, she comes running back, only to be mad at him for also being with someone else. There is never any conclusion as to what exactly happened to them. Last we saw in season 7, they were still engaged and had a wedding coming. Only that she lived with her dad. Then season 8 comes along and...where's Chelsea? She just disappeared and we never hear anything about her or what happened! So because Charlie crashed a police car at the end of season 7, that's it? LAZY!

Larry: The weird, dumb guy that Lyndsey is ""so in love with""(despite thinking he's a moron, but hey, he's got money and his own house). At the end of season 11, Walden pushes him off his deck after accidentally spilling the beans to him. Yet in season 12, it seems he suffered amnesia, cause he's at the hospital with Alan and doesn't seem to mind that Alan was cheating on him all this time.

For a show that used to make some good points in continuity with characters like Miss Pasternak or the pizza guy, all this seems pretty lazy and amateurish.

Then there's the misogyny:

Two and a half men clearly seems to be a show that wants you to hate women. Maybe the creator has some issues with them, I don't know. I don't mind that per se, but if you look at the way the guys are treated and how many double standards the show has, it's really ridiculous. Judith starts that with her enormous alimony AND child support(does she ever work?) and unfair expectations to Alan. Not once does any woman on that show ever pick up any cheque or pay for anything as far as I can remember. They constantly try to change their men(Mia, Chelsea, Walden's ex wife, Zoey, Melissa, even Celeste), but wouldn't do the same for them. They're often shown as alcoholics, greedy or both. Especially in the case of Lyndsey. We all know that Alan is supposed to be a loser who can't be picky. But is she really such a prize? She drinks. She lies. She cheats on Alan constantly. She throws him out of her house for being honest while the only reason he was this honest was cause he caught her lying/hiding things. Then she cheats again, lies again, ruins Alan's wedding and life. And yet Alan keeps chasing after her and everyone always tells us ""what a great woman she is"" and how ""Alan doesn't deserve her"". From all the women Alan dated, I'd have rather seen him get married to someone like Melissa who at least seemed somewhat caring for the most of it. Lyndsey would have deserved to live alone with nothing but her booze.

The show really was carried by Alan/Cryer through most of it. The whole ""I'm drinking, sleeping around and afraid of intimacy"" shtick with Charlie had gotten kind of old already around season 4. Maybe if they would have dared to let Charlie marry Chelsea, who knows...we don't know what was planned for season 8 or 9 if he wouldn't have been fired. But a lot of the jokes could have worked with either one of them. Example: Zoey's daughter sleeps over in Alan's room. She makes Walden(think Charlie) check the closet for monsters. Walden/Charlie opens the closet, is about to say all's fine when he sees Alan's sex doll and shudders and quickly closes the closet again. Ava is satisfied and says she won't have any nightmares tonight, to which Walden/Charlie replies ""I'll have some for sure"".

It works, because it's basically at Alan's expense. The same goes for most of season 9-12. The best episodes usually include the rest of the characters that sadly were dropped for the most of it(Judith, Herb, Jake, Berta). I liked the idea of adding Charlie's daughter and especially the character of Barry. Rather than trying to do a reboot of season 1 with that little foster kid(I really hated him, sorry, he was just annoying), they should have tried to go with Barry. He really added some nice jokes to the show and was like a better version of Jake, who, let's be honest seemed to show that he's not that good an actor, once he reached a certain age.

All in all, I do like the show, but there surely was the potential for a lot more if they would have had better continuity, maybe fewer episodes and made the whole show a little less misogynistic.

But it definitely isn't fair to rate it 1/10, just because people didn't like Ashton. I won't say he is that good/that bad. I continued to watch for Alan and guys like Herb or Barry and to some extent Jake, his grandma or Judith. Walden didn't bother me and some of his storylines were quite good(such as Zoey) and were basically like one Charlie could have had.

People should definitely give the show a little more credit and not just complain about Sheen. Let's face it, as fun as it was with Sheen, the show was already on a downslope even with him and a lot of the stuff in season 4-8 wasn't any better than in season 9-12."
"awesome (with Charlie only , not with Ashton )","Mar 23, 2017",10,5,2,"who doesn't wish to be charlie? He has it all, money, looks, slickness, girls AND is never stressed out never worried about anything !!!!

The show is just pure and plain funny, simple humour, dark humour, complicated humour, naive humour, cute humour, it has it all, I have watched all the seasons several times and I still laugh as if it was the first time.

They should have stopped the show when Charlie left, the seasons with Ashton are simply stupid, boring and dull, nothing compared with the real two and half men with Charlie Sheen."
It doesn't work,"Mar 30, 2021",6,2,2,"The show ends after Charlie. It might as well called ""A half man"" because it just isn't the same without him. It's not fun, the jokes aren't funny and the show is boring. It's a different show. Season 1-8 8/10. After it 4/10."
Two and a Half Men: Season Nine,"Oct 28, 2012",10,5,2,"It is a damn shame this gem of a sitcom came to its bitter conclusion with the death of Charlie Harper. I am sure something could have been done to ease the tensions between Sheen and the producers so that everyone could have remained in their element. Adding Kutcher to the mix not only killed off Sheen's character, but it also killed one of the best sitcoms on American television. Kutcher is a lousy actor in just about every direction and was a bad choice for a replacement. Sheen cannot be replaced-simple as that! I have stopped watching it because it hurts too much to look at the cast that makes up the Harper family and their quirky friends degrade themselves. It is NOT FUNNY ANYMORE! The stories are scattered and the dialog is stupid. Having Kutcher strip every now and then just for laughs is just plain vulgar. Please watch seasons 1-8 and leave well enough alone. It's best to remember this show for the brilliant comedic talent that entertained us loyal fans for eight terrific years."
"A definite guilty pleasure, one just can not help but tune in to this laugh-a-minute generator","Mar 2, 2007",7,3,5,"Charlie (Charlie Sheen) has a house on the beach, near LA. His income from a choice job in the music industry has granted him the great digs and the ability to always have a woman on his arm. However, his brother, Alan (Jon Cryer), a chiropractor, had the rug pulled from under him by a nasty divorce. Having no where to go, Alan and his young son are ""temporarily"" bunking with Charlie. But, is Charlie's carefree lifestyle really a good role model for Alan's son? And, what happens when their Mommie-Dearest mother (Holland Taylor) decides to drop in from time to time? This show is a laugh-a-minute generator for those who can put aside their scruples for a short while. Sheen's character really is rather despicable; he drinks, he chases women, he cheats, etc. But, his dry wit is just infectious. So, too, is Cryer's Alan, a somewhat priggish loser who nevertheless, makes his audience mirthful. Add in a comic little boy, a no-nonsense housekeeper, and a mother from hell and the result is a true guilty pleasure. If you have a strong moral agenda, no, please do not turn into this show. You won't find it humorous and you will be offended. But, for those who like their funnybone tickled and can keep a more open mind, this show is giggles on top of giggles."
"30 minutes of poor forced ""comedy""","Sep 14, 2007",1,50,36,"Charlie Sheen is a fairly good actor in Spin City, Loaded Weapon, and Scary Movie 3. Do not let that fool you when watching 2.5.

Everything in the show is predictable, cliché and fairly repetitive. Every episode also seems to follow the ""scooby doo"" plot line. Soon as you figure it out, this show is all down hill from there. I managed to pick up on it on the first couple episodes while waiting for Family Guy... I've always deemed the show as a low quality and poor comedic 30 mines, so I've never bothered to view it until it was plopped on our local ""my 29"" station.

There is nothing comical about it. After every ""funny"" line is said, they wait to throw in false laughter and wait for people at home to absorb what was just said in HOPE that they laugh.

To conclude it, its the same old same old, except there isn't a gay guy living with a straight guy like we've seen in previous sitcoms. Same plot lines, same poor jokes, just with 2.5 straight ""men""."

I can't see a tech geek replacing Charlie harper and more over there are no beautiful ladies..... Now we have some other good shows like modern family which I can't resist to watch. But I need to thank the whole team of two and a half Men for making such a good show and I enjoyed all the nine seasons a lot. I am mentioning again that for the first nine seasons I rate it 10 out of 10.

Please ax this show!,"May 18, 2012",1,19,10,"I used to watch this show, when it was actually funny ! But now I can't stand it anymore, John Cryer is a show downer! He's

drained the life out of Two and a half men, he didn't deserve the Emmy's he received. For playing a leech who bleeds people dry with his self pity crap! And though Ashton Kutcher maybe cute he is not that funny either. His character is flaccid and a bit of a push over with no back bone! This was Charlie Sheen's show not John Cryer's (aka Alan cry babies)show.I can't stand him ,he is not now nor has he ever been funny. My daughter is right this show has gone down hill a lot since Charlie has left the show.I use to watch it every Monday but now I do not watch it at all. Please take it off already we are begging you. Put us out our misery ! Because this is no longer Two and a half men anymore ! It is the Four pathetic losers ! Sex , getting stoned is not good comedy ! Neither is oral gratification or excessive vomiting due to over drinking! The only time it is even remotely humorous, is when something bad happens to Alan!"
Not a likable character to be found,"Nov 26, 2007",N/A,27,19,"From sampling the variety of use comments on this show,I've noticed that the huge majority of people when moved to comment have said they liked and/or loved this show. I cannot count myself among them.

To be sure,I've only watched a handful of episodes full-through,but I've seen enough to feel like this show,while blessed with a fertile premise(divorced dad with impressionable young son moves in with his brother,a swinging bachelor,and the dad and bachelor are polar opposites),seems to be an exercise in static character progression(or lack thereof)episode after episode. Charlie(Charlie Sheen,a talented and funny guy who is playing...himself,basically)the bachelor is an unrepentant sleaze who never changes,Alan the dad(Jon Cryer,who's done better. Anyone recall ""Partenrs""? ""The Famous Teddy Z""?)is a whiny sad sack who is good at playing the role of doormat and Jake(Angus Jones,who I swear has NOT aged since 2000's ""The Kid""!)is basically a low-energy brat who seems to be laughing at his dad about as much as his uncle--and it would seem,everybody--is. The housekeeper is a burly,cynical air-sucker and Alan's ex is a clueless,emasculating buzz-kill. Throw in a revolving door supply of attractive,vapid(and not particularly moral)young ladies who fancy Charlie,and you have the formula for a show that seems more happy to run in place than add any apparent depth or dimension to the principals.

Before you think me some sort of prude,I can appreciate a sitcom that can revel in amorality--""Married With Children"" and ""Arrested Development"" come to mind--but this show seems to just hold in place,with characters that become more despicable with each episode. Producer and creator Chucke Lorre was able to cull success from ABC's ""Dharma and Greg"",and while he plants good seeds for a show here,it seems to be little more than a chance to re-hash running gags and canned laughter. I guess you can do worse than this show for comedy,but you certainly can do better,network OR cable."
"Terrific Comedy that will Make me Laugh no Matter how many Times I Watch it,","Apr 10, 2015",9,7,4,"Since my opinions of them are significantly different, I have broken this up in to two paragraphs, the first focusing on seasons 1 to 8, and the second on 9 to 12.

Two and a Half Men is a terrific television series with fantastic writing that packs in so many genuine laughs in a mere twenty minutes and an outstanding comedic cast that you can tell loved working together. The first eight seasons are some of my favourite moments in television history, the chemistry and natural comedic timing of Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones is fantastic, watching these old episodes will always bring a smile to my face, if they had ended on the eight season, I would have given this series a ten. My favourite character is definitely Alan, Charlie is of course well developed and superbly written, and Jake is great no matter how old gets, but Alan is a really original character, not like any other I've seen in any television series, he gets the best lines and is caught up in the most hilarious situations, and Jon Cryer's performance is undeniably gold. They aren't the only people that brought me such joy in these seasons however, I also loved the performances of Conchata Ferrell, Holland Taylor, Melanie Lynskey, Ryan Stiles, Jane Lynch, among many others.

As for seasons 9 to 12, the series totally started to jump the shark. Not necessarily in 9 and 10, I think these seasons are underrated, Ashton Kutcher did the best he could and his character was brought in to the series in a good and clever way, but the absence of Charlie Sheen is always noticeable, he was the star of the show and Kutcher simply wasn't enough to fill the void. As for seasons 11 and 12, the series completely started to nuke the fridge, this was when Angus T Jones left, they brought in Charlie's daughter to essentially become the new ""half man"", and it was simply ridiculous, the show became a parody of itself. The twelfth season is even worse, it had a very slow and repetitive storyline of Alan and Walden getting married just so they could adopt a child. The final episode however is probably the worst hour of television I've ever watched, it was very poorly written, broke the fourth wall constantly and had a brutal anti-climatic ending, and we will never know what happened to these characters in the end. Jon Cryer becomes a bigger star after Sheen leaves, no matter how much charm the series may have lost, he didn't lose any, Alan Harper was the only thing that kept me watching.

All in all, the majority of Two and a Half Men is clever and superbly written, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy series, but be prepared for disappointment in the end.

After his wife leaves him, Alan Harper is forced to move in to his millionaire brother Charlie's beach house, a place where constant partying and drinking goes on, but Charlie has to change his ways when Alan's son Jake starts visiting.

Best Performance: Jon Cryer Worst Performance: Chuck Lorre

Best Episode: The Two Finger Rule Worst Episode: Of Course He's Dead"
Wasn't the fact Mr sheen left.,"Aug 19, 2023",7,1,1,"So I watched this show a few times when Charlie sheen was on it. (Didn't care for it much, hated the theme song) I watched it finally from begining to all of the first 6 or 7 seasosns (obviosuly liked it enough to last so long). Season 9 /10 /11 ended and Ashton kushner from the 70's show was on.

Spoliers: So this drama about the show is that Charlie harper dies, some rich guy moves In blah blah get over it. Cool let's accept that move on. Now here where the show turns bad but not for the reasons you'd think (or what I'd did)

The show turns to the only remaining Main character and the same stupid annoying joke every episode. Wow you are a moocher you live with the rich guy yet ur a chiropractor with no money.

This show did not fail because of an actor leaving or being replaced. It's the fact of the same stupid lame main concept joke that just ain't funny became a beaten dead horse.... don't believe me watch it yourself."
Charlie sheen the legend,"Aug 31, 2022",10,2,0,"This rating for first 8 seasons of the show 10/10. I absolutely loved the chemistry between Charlie , Alan, taterhead and Berta . He occasional visits of rose and evelyn were hilarious too.

The rating for the last 4 season should be minus10. These last 4 seasons were single handedly carried by Jon Cryer. Walden was a pathetic character(no offence to ashton kutcher , dude tried his best but he just couldn't replace Charlie s iconic character. Tbh no one can replace Charlie harper) i still don't know why Jake was sent to Japan. Angus's performance was 100x better than Ashton's. And i still can't believe when the showmakers failed to replace Charlie with Walden they introduced Jenny. A character exactly like Charlie just with a pair of titties and don't get me started on the finale. This show ran for 12 yrs it deserved better💔. There are some fun parts in these 4 seasons like drunken lyndsey and barry.

Anyways i enjoyed the first 8 seasons of the show more than i enjoyed friends. This show would definitely be ranked much higher if the writers had never killed Charlie.

#Justiceforcharlie."
Wow what a waste,"Feb 7, 2019",7,1,1,"The only reason I would not give this show a 10 is because Charlie Sheen got fired. I really love season 1 though 8 they were good but they ruined season 9 though 12. I give this show a good rating season 1 though 8. If I can say one person who I liked after Charlie Sheen got fired was Jon Cryer who plied Charlie's brother he was good and he had great chemistry with Charlie Sheen they played off each other well. But he had no chemistry with Ashton Kutcher even though I like him in this show he was not good. Angus T Jones was good in season 1 though 3 or 4 but when he got older his acting sucked and never improved her is where the show failed. 1 (Firing Charlie Sheen) 2 (Bringing in Ashton Kutcher John Stamos was considered for the roll Uncle Jesse from Full House the Full House He-Man) 3 Angus T Jones (Acting started to suck and he also said Two And A Half Men was filth He said this ""If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching Two and a Half Men. I'm on Two and a Half Men and I don't want to be on it. Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it's just entertainment. Do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you you'll have a decision to make when it comes to television, especially with what you watch."" ) 4 Chuck Lorre (Ruined the show very bad he did mess around with The Big Bang Theory a little but not as bad) How I Met Your Mother is way better then this show if Charlie had stayed the show would have been much better. Charlie Sheen said he wants to reboot Two And A Half Men."
Oh the hatred!!!,"Feb 25, 2014",10,2,0,"I have been a huge fan of Two and a Half Men for over six years now. Charlie Sheen left the show and Ashton Kutcher was announced as not so much the replacement but the new big name star character in Walden Schmidt. I, like many was very unsure about the future of the show and how it would cope. I admit it did take some getting used to but after a while I started to accept the change and now see it as a breath of fresh air and still thoroughly enjoy each episode as much as the last. Even though the main star has left the backbone of the show is still there as I never saw Two and a Half Men as ""the Charlie Sheen Show"". Many familiar faces keep up appearances as well as the inevitable introduction of new cast keeping the show evolving and proving life after Charlie. One of the things I cannot believe is how much hatred there is now. Not just hatred but the vile, complete despise people seem to have. An opinion is something we have to accept and respect of other people on a day to day basis and that is part of life. I know not everyone feels this way about the new Two and a Half Men and some people do like it but the general consensus is that of the above... HATRED. My personal opinion is this is still a great show, it's quick, witty eye candy, short 20 minute bursts of switch your mind off and forget about your worries comedy which was the reason I loved the programme in the first place and the reason I still love it now. I hope it continues for a good while yet. Please, if you have never watched since Charlie left give it a chance as a new programme and enjoy the old episodes as well. There is still comedy gold in these new episodes and once you find it you will wonder why you waited so long to try it."
Mindless but funny TV to feel good,"Dec 1, 2021",7,1,1,"This is the prime example of TV to watch while being on your phone.

Its funny, but mostly consists of juvenil humor. You really dont have to know every nuance about the characters or every other episode to get its humor.

But nobody can deny the dip in quality with time. They tried to mix it up after firing Charlie Sheen and replacing him with Ashton Kutscher.

I wouldnt go as far as many people, to say that this show died with Charlie, because there have also been some great moments and jokes afterwards. I especially liked the references to technology.

I feel like what ruined this show wasnt the writing after season 8, but the sudden turn this show took and the way the parted with Sheen. He simply left to big of a whole which was impossible to fill.

Nervetheless its pretty funny and also has a huge rewatch potential, theres just something missing."
Two and a half Manginas since Sheen left,"Apr 12, 2012",1,13,6,"I gotta say, I am really disappointed. Since Charlie Sheen left, this show has gone down the toilet. It was once about two opposite types of men in the current society, it is now about what kind of men fit women's desires It was once about the terrible but still done task of drinking whiskey, it is now of drinking tea with their legs crossed. This is not supposed to be a serious show. It used to mock reality but now it is a Mangina guide for our future male generations. And the worst part, wait for it. It is not funny. This was one of the only sitcoms that stepped out of the comfort zone in a cozy way.

Now they introduced an overweight lesbian womanizer who can supposedly make a girl straight girl sleep with her but not with Walden. End this show before it gets completely destroyed."
Best sitcom,"Mar 29, 2020",10,2,0,"I would recommend a sitcom lover to watch the show for its sheer brilliance. Watch it for the epic one liners, Charlies' charisma, Charlie's and Alan's chemistry, Jake's innocence (till he was a kid), Berta and all the super hot ladies. However, the show has lost its Sheen (Literally) after Charlie quit it."

Don't be fooled by 7/10, this show is definitely my favourite comedy in it's prime.... By far! But after season 8 it just dipped so much! For some it might still be good but for most it's not.

Funny Show...,"Jun 30, 2023",8,2,0,"I remember watching this show while I was growing up thinking it was the funniest thing ever even though 99% of the jokes were going over my head. Recently though now that I'm in my 20s I decided to rewatch Two and a half Men and by god I think this show is probably the funniest show ever to air besides Seinfeld. The only real issue I have with Two and a half Men is that I really wish they would have ended the show when Charlie Sheen was fired. Don't get me wrong Ashton Kutcher is a funny actor but his presence in Season 9-12 felt forced and him being casted changed the entire show's dynamic.

I also hated how they made Alan seem more and more pathetic each episode. Alan is a completely different character from season 1-8 than season 9-12. I honestly prefer Alan from the first eight seasons.

The way I see it they should have either stuck it out with Charlie or they should have ended it. Don't get me wrong there are some good laughs between season 9-12 but nothing compared to what Charlie Sheen brought to the table.

I heard now that Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen are getting along we might see some sort of Two and a half Men reboot?! I honestly thing that would be great but only if the original cast returns in full. The only unfortunate person that couldn't return would be Berta as she passed away in 2020. However I definitely feel a reboot or revival could work. Maybe even include Ashton Kutcher somehow?!?!

I definitely recommend Two and a half Men. Enjoy!"
Who's gonna bring the sluts with charlie dead???,"Sep 30, 2013",7,1,1,"I've been watching this show for like a year and a half now, and I think it rocked with charlie in it. Without Charlie it's down to zero. The director made a mistake in doing it so. Alan, Jake and Walter are a good team but with charlie it was best. I Mean who is gonna bring sluts to the beach house with charlie dead. Walter?? well i don't think so.

Now 11th season is coming up and i hope that it's better then the last one. Well best of luck to the New team and Good Bye to charlie.I saw Charlie as the image of two and a half men.

Walter is nice guy, but not as good as good as charlie (No Offence), Two and a half men was my most favorite show with charlie in it. now it ain't now that place is taken by Game of Thrones"
"Two and a Half Men - 1 man + 1 man - 1/2 man + 1/2 man = 2,5 Men","May 28, 2024",9,2,0,"After rewatching Two and a Half Men, it has opened my eyes. Originally, I was one of those who thought that Two and a Half Men was best with Charlie Sheen and that no one could replace him. As I watched the series, I could clearly see that Charlie Sheen began to have serious problems. The question then was whether Ashton Kutcher could fill Sheen's shoes. In my opinion, this is something Kutcher manages to do.

One can see that Two and a Half Men as a series develops over time. The series begins as a funny and cozy sitcom that gradually becomes more mature and features more coarse humor. There is a dynamic development in the relationship between Alan and Charlie, and we see an evolution in each of them. In the series, we also follow Jake's growth from a little boy to a grown man.

The TV show has provided many good memories and joy over the years. Even though the concept started to become quite worn out towards the end, the series managed to keep the humor at its peak until the very end."
Over after Charlie,"Apr 10, 2021",7,1,1,I like Ashton in a lot of things but this show is nit one of them.
Nothing speical,"Mar 18, 2021",6,1,2,"CHARLIE : The whole concept of Charlie being some kind of a pick up artist makes no sense at all,he is pretty old (38 in first episode),he is slightly below average looking for his age,he dresses cheap,and he doesn't have charisma for picking up chicks.Barney Stinson is 1000x better character in every way,he is much better looking,he is in late tewnties,he is dressing nicely and his charisma for picking up chicks and his charisma in general are waaaaay better. Charlie is being mean to his younger brother,he is talking down to him and he is making fun of him,while he is just slightly less louser than him.That is like basketball player who scored 3 points makes fun of another player in his team who has scored 2 points.The whole show he is behaving like some lazy working class guy,but he is acctualy rich and can afford prostitutes that cost 2000 dollars per night.Another nonsense.

JAKE : Jake is really funny and cute in first two or three seasons.When he started going to high school he started behaving like typical jackass teenager who will end up working in McDonalds.

BERTA : She is a typical 55-ish year old fat suburban woman that works as a maid.Her jokes are on point for this kind of a show and her character doesn't have any fllows.In fact,I think she is the best written character in the show.

ALAN : He is more educated and works more than Charlie but yet he has less money,.He is pretty clumsy but he gets laid pretty often with girls that are younger and much prettier than him.

There is no character development in the whole show,except for Jake. I would classify humor in this show as ""childish"",but on contrary the humor in HIMYM I would classify as ""adaultish"" By my standards this is an average show 6/10. (Seasons 1-8)

I watched the first two episodes of season 9,and I would rather watch paint dry than continue."
One of the worst shows ever,"Oct 14, 2010",1,37,28,"This show is an example of the worst of television. I don't know why this show is still around and I have to wonder about the people who like it. The main characters are a womanizing alcoholic and a gutless whiner who lets women take advantage of him. That's bad enough but even worse is the stations that transmit the reruns. The same group of episodes re-broadcast over and over again. Watching clothes in the dryer is more entertaining than this airtime filler. Worst of all is the fact that Charlie Sheen will rake in nearly $98,000,000 for the next two seasons. Why can't networks come up with more programming that's actually entertaining? Do yourself a favor and change the channel, take a walk, or play with the kids. Don't waste your time with this show."
Very Funny Show Season 1 through Season 8,"May 29, 2020",10,3,1,"Season 1 through 8 - this show was hilarious while Charlie Sheen was on the show. After Sheen left, the show was unwatchable. I know they paid Sheen plenty. He was worth every penny."
Great show,"May 1, 2021",7,1,2,It was great with Charlie Sheen. I haven't seen that many with Ashton Kutcher but they are still not that bad.
"Overrated, not funny","Nov 8, 2008",1,47,38,"I've watched many episodes and tried to enjoy two and a half men but i just can't. This show is good for two types of people, for those with a bad sense of humour and are amused by the same re-cycled, clichéd jokes over and over again, and those who want to laugh at such a terrible failed attempt at comedy because nothing else is on. For myself I've made the decision to never watch this show on TV again just for the mere purpose of not contributing to ratings. If you insist on watching, perhaps the most amusing part of two and a half men is the over-exaggerated laugh track. Expect laughter to follow almost everything a character says or does. At least they could tone it down a bit, because not one of the characters are funny or even likable. Charlie Sheen has never been funny, while his gay brother and fat ugly nephew are just irritating! Please, if you want funny watch Seinfeld or King Of Queens. Funny sitcoms starring funny actors/comedians!"
Please bring back Charlie!!,"May 15, 2013",N/A,7,3,"Why? Why? I liked this show so much... But they ruined it.. It just sucks without Charlie.. The show isn't funny anymore. The character Charlie played was just awesome. But now its like there are to of Alan..

And then... WHY WOULD YOU PUSH CHARLIE IN FRONT OF A TRAIN??!?

This new character is as bad as hell. He isn't AT ALL!! Everything he says is just crap. Always crying about ""his girl"".. Every single episode is the same.. He and Alan are just gay at some points of the series..

I went from watching every night... To avoid it every night

Charlie.. I will always remember you.. Please come back

Show with Charlie 10/10 Show without Charlie 1/10"
Great Show with Sheen,"Jul 2, 2020",10,3,1,They should reprise the show with Sheen. It would be a big hit again. I just got through watching Seasons one through eight. I laughed continuously. Sheen as Charlie Harper and Alan Cryer as Alan Harper we're comedy magic.
"Outstanding, long lasting comedy","Mar 14, 2015",7,1,2,"This has had a long run, maybe longer then it should, but I still believe it is a great and fun timeout to tune in on and watch after a long day at the office :)

This has changed through out the series, the biggest is the one people rant about here in the comments, Charlie Sheen being kicked out and replaced by a younger model, Aston Kutcher. But before Charlie was actually replaced the series went down hill and suffered because of his problems, it was time for a change and even though it isn't the same without Charlie, I think Aston does a fine job as the next best thing.

This is really a good series, it has given me many laughs and I am sorry to see it go, but it is time to move on and give space to something new. This series clearly does deserve the many nominations and wins of Emmy's that it has gotten and the constant supporting character Alan Harper played by Jon Cryer is really, really great."
Despite Sheen or Kutcher .... the show is amazing!,"Apr 21, 2023",10,3,1,"Sheen has a bullet up his ass , thinks he's too good for anyone else. The show didn't give up. And survived and good on them! All episodes s1 to s 12 are all just as good as each other. Watch the show for the show... not just because u like the person being the character. Either way the show is perfect! Sheen needed to be taken down a notch and Kutcher did a brilliant job! The show is brilliant right from the very first episode and then right up to the very last second of the episode. Anyone that thinks otherwise are not even paying attention to the actual show and story line. The same plot line was getting old and this was exactly what the show needed to move on and make a bigger name for themselves. I honestly wish they kept it going, was very sad to see It end!"
This show needs to come to an end very soon.,"Feb 23, 2014",6,1,2,"I never loved this show when Charlie Sheen was in it but it had found it's own category of comedy that suited his talents. I would have been perfectly happy if it was cancelled after he was fired but of course the creators were not yet ready to let go. It was important to create a new lead character as Ashton has limited talents, and playing a dimwitted pretty boy is as far as his abilities stretch. That was a smart move on their part by not overestimating him. In the first few new episodes I found myself thinking this is rubbish but as you progress it gets easier to watch. It may not be as good as the Charlie Sheen seasons but it keeps the show at an above average pace.

It's good to see Alan, Berta & Jake so continuity can remain. They keep the tone of the show as it was before and support Walden in a way that makes him more interesting. I can handle it if they keep Two and a half men on the air for a few more seasons but any more than that will be pushing it."
Without Charlie...,"Feb 1, 2020",10,3,1,Without Charlie Sheen the show was unfunny and unwatchable. Ashton Kutcher has no timing or delivery.
First 6 seasons were great. What about the rest?,"Apr 1, 2012",7,1,2,"A lot of people, watching season 9 of Two and a Half Men say they want Charlie Sheen back. Most of them probably disregard season 7 and 8. When the show began it had the vibe of e fresh, original and, of course, funny show. We had the cute kid Jake, the awkward nice guy dad Alan and the charming playboy Charlie. The problem with successful shows like this one is that the some people don't want to stop it while it's good but want to squeeze out every bit of funny in it until you end up getting bored with your favorite program of worse - you begin to dislike it. Most of the people I know including myself agree that the show was at its finest up to season 6. It went down the hill after that. And why? Simply because they couldn't think of anything interesting to do in the series, so the writers decided to make Alan as pathetic as possible, showing new lows almost every episode. Charlie became a cliché - the guy who constantly drinks, goes out with lots of women and from time to time realizes how his way of like keeps him from a real stable relationship. I was actually looking forward to see season 9 because I though that would give the writers a chance to refresh things. Well... I guess they did make changes but definitely not for the good. I've seen almost the full 9th season and I honestly think it takes the writers 15 minutes to make a 21 minute episode. The show went from witty to childish yet not for children because of the dirty, perverted hints and gross comments. Unlike other reviewers I don't think it's Ashton Kutcher's fault. He was the writers' chance to make a change for the better - to come up with episodes with witty humor in a different direction because they have introduced a new character. I think that because they know the show will always have a high rating they don't bother to come up with anything worthy for the series. In fact sometimes I get the paranoid feeling they are testing the viewers to see how much fart, poop and throw-up jokes they can take before they think to themselves ""Wait! That's not smart!"" The only reason I still watch the show is because I have the slightest hope of the new episode coming back to the smart end not to the ""I can't believe I used to live with a gorilla"" end."
Bad one liners followed by canned laughter,"Aug 1, 2005",1,60,52,"First of all this show is just not funny, and its time they stopped making these pathetic sitcoms. Why would any network give Charlie Sheen his own show after he ruined Spin City. This show can be summed up in one sentence; bad one liners followed by canned laughter. Canned laughter does not make a show funny, it's a tired technique that has been used far too much and lost what little effect it ever had. Its sad when a show is so unfunny that fake laughter has to be used in order to tell the audience that it's supposed to be funny, and its even sadder when it works. Show's like this are standard B grade comedy that wouldn't have been original in the 90's the hey day of sitcoms. Shows such as 'Scrubs', 'Arrested development' and even 'malcom in the middle' are infinitely better than show such as 'Two and a half men', 'Joey' and 'My wife and kids'. Shows that, not only deserve to be cancelled, but should never have been picked up in the first place."
Best Sitcom Ever,"Aug 26, 2020",10,3,1,"It is the best show ever till S8 Ashton Kutcher isn't bad but Charlie Sheen just killed it! The endings seasons felt like GOT tbh Doesn't mean the show is bad or anything, its my favourite sitcom till Season8. A must Watch."
It's OK,"Feb 14, 2008",6,1,9,"I like Charlie Sheen. People say we look and act alike. The show is funny and entertaining. However, yes there is a however Charlie carries the show. Situation comedies have become so dated and predictable. Like cop show's with the car chase, with the guy on the hood who rolls off just in time before before the car explodes sitcom's have become very formulated. All sitcoms have 1) the annoying ex 2) the annoying family or in laws 3) the protagonist get into trouble doing a stupid act and 4) the protagonist use sharp one liners to get out of trouble. I know what is going to be said before the line is delivered. A producer needs to turn the sitcom upside down, on its head, like Trailer Park Boys. Give Charlie a few twists and new spins to work with. Still a good show Charlie. 6 out of 10."
I don't get it!,"Jul 14, 2016",3,3,0,"I have seen this show on TV for yeeeears now and i laugh just about never. I mean when is it funny? I cant see it.

I work night shifts now a days. Where i mostly just sit on my ass watching TV (its not a cozy work place, trust me) On one channel there is every day 4 episodes of the big bang theory, which is funny. But than comes 4 episodes of two and a half men. Its just not funny, it feels so fakish. People are crying about Charlie Sheen not being on the show any more, but common, it was not funny with him eighter.

The only thing making me watch this show, is the average story. Its not great, but it can be viewed."
Hilarious,"Dec 29, 2004",N/A,10,8,"Okay, I've been watching most of these episodes, and they are absolutely smegging hilarious! Mainly, though, what I like about the show is the fact that the son, Jake, acts like a regular kid of his age, rather than a walking smart-aleck generator or a nauseatingly cute kid (Michelle from Full House, I'm looking at you) like on some other shows.

Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer are a perfect odd couple. There are usually at least 5-10 moments in each episode that make me laugh my head off. Plus, Rose the Stalker (who lives under their house) usually has a few funny lines whenever she shows up. As long as they don't ""Fonzify"" or ""Urkelize"" her (i.e., focus the show only on her), this show should remain funny for a while. I give it 4.75 out of 5 stars."
It was better with Charlie.,"Dec 31, 2019",8,3,1,"Ashton Kutcher was not bad; he wasn't anything special. But all in all, he did his job but I think it should have ended with Charlie Harper. They could've easily cut it off on the last season with Charlie Sheen in it but they decided to continue it out. 8/10."
"Entertaining show, but a lot of repetition","Jul 3, 2022",6,0,0,"First of all, it wonders me that they actually made 12 seasons. I mean at the beginning there were interesting characters and things happening to them. And most of the jokes were super funny and I laughed out loud. But later on, even before Sheen was out of the picture, it actually started to show that they rarely came up with new ideas or jokes.

I think I liked the first four seasons the best, S5 and S6 were sort of okay, from S7 and S8 I watched only few episodes. I did like S9 and some parts of S10 and fewer of S11.

But the last season was terrible.

At this point the same jokes were just lazy writing.

Actually I felt there were four jokes they milked way too much: *Alan not paying anything and living in the house rent free.

*Alan's son being incredibly stupid.

*Alan never leaving the house.

*Smoking pot.

And I feel like they completely lost interest in Walden's character and made him lost the some sort of personality he had in S9. And while it kind of made sense that they needed a new ""half man"" to the house, it was very boring that most of the season 12 was just about that kid. Or at least it felt like that to me.

Also the characters didn't even develop that much. Alan was the same freeloader as he was in the beginning and never really showed growth or taking responsibilities. Charlie's character also was very true to his habits, but still managed to carry the show. Walden did some improvement, but I think they could have made that character a lot better.

The show was entertaining and gave some good laughs, but 12 seasons was way too much of Alan taking advantage of everybody around him."
I went alogn all seasons and there are two series.. but don't get me wrong I liked both,"Oct 16, 2020",8,3,1,"First 8 seasons with Charlie was great, I mean he was the man of the show (nevertheless in 8 season you can see him acting very aggressively maybe because his personal life was falling apart, good man a real trouble maker) but not less important you can taste a very good performance of Alan and Berta as well.. Jake well too stupid character the kid tried but... then with Walden it was flavourless the first episodes of 9 season but as you keep watching it.. it changes and gets better and remarkably Alan did a great great performance himself so good that you can really feel the character. In general a sitcom to watch by yourself enjoy some classic jokes and get a good time

Better without Charlie,"May 17, 2012",6,0,12,"I've never been a hardcore fan of 2½ men but used to watch it now and then, when it was on and there was nothing better to do. Never liked the character of Charlie Harper, he was not believable, and badly portrayed by the lowsy actor Charlie Sheen. He was just himself and could not even make that convincing enough. Pathetic is the right word.

Since they canned Charlie Sheen and replaced him with Ashton Kutcher, the show has become so much better I actually watch it every week. I love the chemistry between Walden and his girlfriend Zoe, she is hilarious. The show is not only about one person anymore it's about all of the cast and it makes all the difference.

I hope the last episode where Jake and Eldridge joined the army means they are out from the show because those guys weren't that funny anymore. It's the same joke over and over again, it's only funny the first few times after that it just becomes annoying.

Hoping for a great next season!"

voting,"Dec 9, 2011",10,4,2,"I watch two and half men for years.I like this sitcom so much.I think that all actors - Charlie, Berta, Alan, Evelyn, Jack and others - play their best and they seems to play their real life.When I watch the movie suppose that I'm watching my friends' house.This is really familiar and many of my friends love TAHM so much.Without Charlie Sheen, this sitcom is worthless.I voted it 10 points.After Charlie leaves, I watched 2 parts and it's really bad.I never watch again new episodes.I think that voting would be separated to two.with Charlie and without him.otherwise the voting point is confusing.Of course other of cast playing well but Charlie Sheen is soul of it.

2 separate shows,"Jul 27, 2022",2,3,0,"I can totally understand the frustration of Chuck Lorre, transmitting he is a regular, basic human being, vengefull and not respectfull for the money/ fame Charlie brought. I expected more... But, even if Cryer is a very good actor, in the last seasons his character turns into a hideous caricature which is hard to watch. I admire the courage of Kutcher, it seems natural for him to portrait a 30 yo child. Fitting in this show is another storry... Lynskey and Thorne are the ups in the second part.

So, 10 stars for Sheen, 1 for the rest 5 (and a half) for the show."
It's all over!,"Oct 13, 2011",N/A,7,5,"As the saying goes, ""ALL good things must come to an end."" I will no longer be watching the show. Ashton is about as big a miscast as you can get. Chuck Lorre's minute of revelation to hire Ashton when he was on the verge of bringing back Sheen was ill fated.

Lorre didn't know it but the answer to saving the show was already on the show - Herb! The few shows that Herb was in he was hilarious! Alan and Herb have great chemistry. All Lorre had to do was have Judith and Herb split, Herb moves in with Alan and Jake (house paid for after Charlie's death). Can you imagine some of the zany dates they can give Herb while he and Judith are separated. How about some crazy double dates for Alan & Herb. How about Judith dropping by giving them both a hard time. It would also open the door for more Jake, Judith, Berta and Evelyn.

Chuck Lorre you missed the boat! The answer was right under your nose. Instead you took your one minute of revelation and turned a masterpiece into a complete disaster.

From Best to Worst,"Dec 21, 2014",6,0,0,"Once when Charli was there it was the Best Sitcoms ever with the best humor, Script and Casting. Now it's awful from story to everything. 20 minutes looks like 20 hours and had to stop in the middle. It's best they should have stopped it when Charli quit at least it's good they finally decided to finish it off. They really don't know how to proceed further they lost the plot and taking it without any direction. Marriage between Jon Cryer and Aston Kutcher is the stupidity at its peak and without any sense of humor. Script and a Screenplay is so without any sense. They really lost on how to proceed even for them this final finale 22 episode must be like 220 episodes to close it. We can really see their problem on screen."
What if Full House brought the funny?,"Sep 21, 2006",8,4,3,"The best sitcoms aren't the ones which announce their arrival by flaunting self congratulatory phrases on TV or in the print media. The funnier shows aren't that high concept, often start slow, with a few shaky jokes/episodes while the writers flesh out the characters and story lines. I've never seen any of these shows from their pilot episode, in fact I've usually been looking the wrong way.

You hear about shows like 'Two and a Half Men', 'Seinfeld' and 'Arrested Development' from your friends or on message boards online, check out an episode or two on TV and get drawn into it. Last weekend I rented the first two seasons on DVD to give this show a fair go, and I was quite pleased with the results. While not packing in as many jokes/gags per minute as 'Arrested Development' and not as iconic as 'Seinfeld's - no hugging no learning no-thing philosophy', this is still quite an entertaining show. Some of the jokes miss, and the laugh track seems irritating at times.

Raunchy jokes are funny. Raunchy jokes in front of impressionable kids are funnier. I'd find it harder to believe that a kid wouldn't be hearing some particularly non-PC comments in a house with 2 guys. Yet the funniest episodes by far seem to focus predominantly on Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer (sorry Angus, but you get some great one-liners). Two standout episodes include Charlie and Alan pretending to be a gay couple at a party (it sounds clichéd, but Jon's flame-out is hilarious) and Chris O'Donnell's appearance as Charlie's ex-girlfriend with a sex change operation (You are now forgiven for Batman & Robin). Supporting cast is wonderful as well, with genuinely funny performances by Melanie Lynskey as Rose, the lovable psychopath, and Holland Taylor as the boys insufferable mother.

I'd like to close, by reiterating what was said by another reviewer on this site. One of the reason why this show works for me at least, is that writers never go out of their way to lobotomize Charlie on the show simply because he's living with his nephew. Unlike other shows, which are 'family-themed', here the inclusion of a child actor doesn't 'rock someone's world' thereby resulting in dramatic changes about which the character complains throughout the show before learning to live with them. It's enjoyable seeing Charlie treat Jake as an adult and not compromise on his own philandering lifestyle at the same time. Add Jon Cryer's neurotic Allen now trying to restart his love life, throw in sex jokes a pinch of physical comedy, and you get a laid back show that entertains - which is all I ever wanted from a sitcom to begin with."

There are a lot of people that want to see others episodes from the show , new ones, with Charlie Sheen, but the directors don't want him back, all the fans want him back , Charlie also want to come back and play other seasons but the directors deny him. I'm begging the directors to let him play more and to make us all laugh again because this TV show is one of the best ever made. Please listen the voice of your fans and let Charlie play . I hope that more fans will write here opinions and pro / contra for this TV show . Charlie Sheen is now a new man, he quit drinking and he want to came back and make more episodes from Two and a Half Men .Why don't you give him a chance? Why ? This TV show is one of the best.

I can't understand Season 12,"Dec 5, 2014",7,0,1,"Can anyone tell me if the writer of episodes knows about the audience anything. He is simulating season 1 and trying to proceed with no leading role female and this is ridiculous. All the past seasons were popular because of the nature of relationships of Charlie first and Walden afterwards. Those actors are brilliant but the writer and director are killing this series. Bring Charlie back and this will create controversy to the present characters and unleash a gold mine of events and the rates are guaranteed to be sky high. Please don't ruin this hilarious series. This series were escalating rapidly and now it is in downfall mode. If anyone compare it with big bang theory or any other comic series the difference is so wide and big. The competitive is giving new ideas and generate a lot of satisfactions all over the world while two and half men is walking in one leg with the most unwanted ideas from the writer. I think the director want to recycle the episode in completely wrong way and the female characters must have strong role as before and I can't realize the wisdom of the gay marriage between Walden and Alan, come on no one can believe that Walden can't have the luck to marry one woman and get a baby with her. I know all the episodes were written but the dramatic line must be fluctuating more than ever to erase the shadow beginning of Season 12."
How great was Charlie Sheen,"Dec 9, 2019",4,3,0,Great example how important a great actor to a show.
Series Ruined by Chuck Lorre,"Mar 21, 2012",9,3,2,"I did not rated the full series as awful, only season 9. I don't know what the writer/director were thinking when they brought in Ashton Kutcher. The only presence of Ashton Kutcher ruined the series. He can't act and now there is nothing funny left in the series now, only some dumb ass acting; which is in no way catchy or funny.

But they did not stopped there; they are now bringing Charlie's Character back as a ghost(Kathy Bates); man what is wrong with this Chuck Lorre.

You see there is a pattern with Chuck Lorre; first he creates a good series like 2 & 1/2 man and the big Bang Theory; both the series were original and also funny as hell at first but then don't know why he turned them into the sloppy shows that they are today.

The main characters like Charlie Sheen or Jim Parsons used to be

not the normal Joe kind of characters, but they were classy, funny and catchy actors; the writer turned them both into the main stream neurotic sort of funny guys, who are really not funny any more.

Now i think that Charlie Sheen was not totally wrong in what he did; Chuck Lorre totally destroyed both the series. I hope Jim Parson leave the Big Bang Theory, he do not deserve this."
Kutcher Jumped the Shark!,"Sep 21, 2013",5,5,1,"As much as I really hate to admit this, Charlie Sheen really made the show enjoyable and laughable. While Sheen's private life is like the show and really the guy, made it funny. Despite what he has been going through.

When Kutcher came into the show, it really made it, hence the title, Jump the Shark. And that the show became humorless as Kutcher, whom I am no fan of either, really ruined a good show.

Had Sheen and the producers got their act together, more on the former's part then the latter's part. And that they settled their differences, the show would still be as funny with Sheen than without it.

CBS still has the show going on. But Kutcher has ruined a once enjoyable show."
Just end the show already,"Oct 25, 2011",N/A,6,4,"Whoever thought you can recast the main character as Hollywood's biggest douche was not thinking clearly. Ashton Kutcher is a movie actor reject, and now returns to television to try and make a living, well guess what, you are no longer funny. Kutcher has been typecast into too many romantic comedies and 'stupid' thrillers, while married to a Demi Moore who is twice his age, that our opinion of him is badly coloured. Let us rally in order to pull this miserable piece of crap of a show off the air. The producers (tv exec's) are just trying to push this garbage down our throats and expect us to like it but guess what, Charlie Sheen made this show what it is, and without him, it is moot."
7.0 for 2.5Men? A joke?,"Oct 5, 2021",10,3,2,Who wathed will know this rating is bulls poop. The Charlie piece was beyond scale and Ashton was pretty good too. For Me it should be 8.3 for whole series. 9.0 from Charlies and 7.5 from Ashtons.
All 7 stars to charlie sheen,"Mar 2, 2021",7,0,2,"Okay finished watching season 8, up untill now I totally loved charlie Harper's character and the guy who played it. Charlie sheen's comic timing, facial expressions were so damn funny it kind of glued me till this point in entire show. However when I started watching season 9 episode 1, in the middle of the episode I just stopped watching it. I thought they must have brought him back at some point later in the show. So i skipped all episode and started watching the last episode of the show which is season 12 episode 16. Also skipped the whole episode to have just one glimpse of Charlie sheen in the show. But I was gravely disappointed. Till this day, I haven't watched a single whole episode with that replaced guy whatever his name is. I just missed charlie sheen. Every once in a while I watch any random episode from first eight season, that guy never fails to make me laugh."
Great Show,"Aug 16, 2008",8,3,2,"Funny how this show rates better than ELR or KOQs.

I think newness helps the ratings.

This is a very funny show. The kid is a comic genius. I never really knew this guy John Cryer but he is a screamer.

And of course Sheen a big screen star plays a somewhat straight guy. Sorry about the play on words there. He certainly is almost never sober. LOL I have seen the majority of the shows in syndication because my roommate refuses to watch sitcoms. I have seen them all. I just watched all of them from my DVR which I set to record all of the shows.

Fun show."
"For what it was, it was good","Apr 30, 2018",6,0,2,"But for Chrise-ake, can you really *blame* Lorre for firing Sheen? Even SHEEN said he'd have fired himself!

They did the best with what was left to them. Lorre was not responsible for what happened to the show."
One of only a few consistently outstanding sitcoms I've ever seen!,"Mar 17, 2008",9,4,4,"Two and a Half Men is definitely a surprise because it is such a simple and formulaic premise  two polarly opposite brothers are stuck living together with one of their sons, while one tries to be a good father and mentor while the other tries to be a good womanizerand mentor. The amazing thing is that even though the formula is so simple it just works so well.

Charlie Sheer stars as himself, basically, with the curious addition that he writes jingles for commercials and opening songs for TV shows and whatnot, a career that affords him a surprisingly comfortable lifestyle with a home on the Malibu beach that, because he works at home, he rarely has to leave unless he wants to. Add to the mix his brother Alan (played with precise perfection by Jon Cryer) and his son Jake, who might be the highlight of the whole series.

There are some odd moments, such as the woman who is obsessed with Charlie and routinely climbs over his back fence and knocks on his back door, your typical stalker, except she just happens to have a PhD in the psychology of Human Behavior. What? Does she never notice her own behavior? At any rate, although she rarely adds to the humor of the show, the rest of the cast are wonderful, and for a show in which Charlie's sexual escapades so routinely share an environment with a 12-year-old boy, the show is just great fun."
Without Charlie it's not the same,"Dec 15, 2014",6,0,0,"The main reason I gave this series a six on ten vote is because in my opinion the real star of the show, the one who made it so popular was no longer on it after season eight. I'm of course referring to Charlie Sheen.

Yes, Ashton Kutcher is a handsome young man and may also be a talented actor, although I find him irritating at times, however the absence of Charlie is strongly felt on this show and it's certainly not the same.

Now back to the original ""Two and half men"" (with Charlie Sheen) this show was quite refreshing in terms of cast and overall plot. The writing was OK for the most part, but the character development was quite lacking. They all seem to maintain the same tone throughout, making them rather predictable and a little bit monotone. Still I had my fair share of laughs watching this show."
"Poor characters, poor plot, unfunny jokes...","Jan 6, 2012",1,8,3,"I don't get how people find this popular. You have two brothers, one a narcissistic playboy who beds women like candy, and the other a scrubby freeloader/mama's boy. Rounding out the cast is a lump of a child (the scrub's son,) a housekeeper whose whole purpose is to snark, and whatever disposable piece of tail the playboy brings over. They all seem to hate each other, or love each other depending on the episode.

I wouldn't even call them characters as opposed to joke delivery vehicles. Characters need to grow and be likable, and none of these are, yes, including Charlie Sheen. Or even if they are unlikable, they need to be in a way that's hilarious. John Cleese in Fawlty Towers showed how this could work. But they never are, whether its the Sheen character chasing after some girl who is bad for him, ad nauseum, or it's the other brother hitting Sheen up for money in an oily, weaselly way. It's soulless crap, and one of the reasons I dislike the modern sitcom so much.

Even the theme song grates, because these are the unmanliest men you will meet, either overcompensating or being ineffectual. In fact, behind the laugh track is cynicism, a world full of unlikable people. I recommend passing on this."
"Laughing is the best med, this show is an healing show","Sep 28, 2007",10,4,4,"Priceless fun twice a day ! I needed some distraction and now I got an addiction. I will prescribe this funny show for healing purpose. I never laugh so much. Yes the Doctor help, the pills help, the friends help.....But Jake takes all my problems away twice a day, the kid is a miracle to me. I needed to laugh and this show did the job. I am very grateful for the talented and gifted souls in it and behind it. It is a Masterpiece. Brilliant cast and incredible writers. Everyone is lovable, the setting is pleasant, and everything is flowing so perfectly. I find myself laughing in the street when a scene comes back to me. First time of my life the commercial breaks do not bother me, I need time to recover from laughing so much. It is a trip to planet Joy. A blessing to television, thank you..."
"good series, truly.","Sep 23, 2016",7,0,0,"As funny as funny stuff gets.

If you wanna laugh, this is the series to go, and Charlie Sheen is the man for it.

And his brother, Alan, is also up to the mark. But after Sheen's departure, the movie lost quite some of its cutting-d\edge indeed. You know the drill- the nonchalant, flamboyant and well-to-do bachelor, right? Well this is the classic scene, but anyhow, not a letdown, ever. Tremendous acting, by accomplished actors. Like I said, and I don't like repeating things, but IMDb won't let me publish a review if it has less than 10 line, which can be a real pain in the neck sometimes, I'm telling you, this series is easily up there amidst the likes of Seinfeld and the others. Totally recommend."
The same old rehashed jokes ... again ...,"Jul 18, 2006",1,55,49,"Do you know how you can tell when the writers on a sitcom are losing steam? Just wait for the tired old frat-boy gags to show up... the younger woman-older man, two women making out etc.

TAAHM is no better - Sheen is once again typecast as a Lothario - it was endearing in Spin City, but is a bit tiring here. The jokes are the same, the young nephew who knows all about life, and his Dad trying to use code words around him. Come on people, I'm sure we can find better shows than this poor excuse for humor. The only show that has plumbed the bottomless abyss of mediocre writing any deeper is the NBC disaster 'Joey'. I am no prude, but having a 10 year old say some of the racier lines is bound to scar him for life.

The sooner they put this show out to pasture, the better."
perfect filler,"Jan 1, 2006",N/A,4,2,"After the dearth of poor comedies that i watched to fill the huge hole left by Friends and Frasier this was the one that finally filled my laughter quotation. Batchelor Charlie,Charlie Sheen,finds his happy life of wine,women and fun interrupted by the arrival of his brother Alan,Jon Cryer,who has been kicked out of his home by his wife who has discovered that she prefers women.Add to this concoction Alans son Jake,Angus T Jones, who comes at weekends and you have the recipe for a very funny if slightly risqué sitcom. The humour mostly comes from how playboy Charlie gets along with his strait laced brother Alan and his nephew Jake who isn't as innocent as he should be. One of the major pulls of this program is the string of attractive women that Charlie sleeps with but for me the biggest reason for watching this is Melanie Lynsky who plays Rose,a woman that Jake slept with once and has now become his harmless ,slightly obsessive stalker. The humour when Jake is around can be a bit too adult but any program with Melanie Lynsky in it can be forgiven for such a slight foible. Not in the Friends and Frazier league but still funny enough to get 8/10"
Men Men Men Men Manly Men Men Men,"Nov 15, 2007",8,6,8,"The title of this show does not lie. It is about Men. Two brothers & a son of the one brother. Charlie Sheen (Charlie Harper) & Jon Cryer (Alan) the main men play off each other very well. The ensemble has very good chemistry. The writing is very sharp. They really go for the comic jugular often & hit the target a lot more than they miss.

Luckily it is called men because the themes of the comedy are very mature most of the time. There are some women in the cast. The maid (Berta) is often there in Charlies beach house where they all live & most of the action takes place. Alans ex-wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) often provides obstacles for Alan usually involving their son Jake (Angus T Jones). Holland Taylor (Evelyn Harper) the brothers mom is along quite a bit too. Even though she has been married 3 or 4 times, she is still listed as Harper, but she is presented as the mom who changes husbands like bed sheets so why should she change her name?

This sit-com is not ground breaking as the jokes used have been around for a long time. This ensemble makes them come off as fresh because of their talent. Angus Jones was really a good choice for the son as he fits well.

Charlie is the bachelor who like playing the field. Alan is the divorcing father who is very self-conscience (almost paranoid) & feels his existence is being threatened by everyone he is around. He lives at Charlies beach house and his son Jake is there too, though sometimes he is with mom.

The plots involve lots of women as Charlie always seems to get his share & lots of guest stars. This is one of the better Sit-Com's going now but it keeps the comedy simple & direct, and that is what makes this a very good show."
Never the same after Charlie left,"Sep 1, 2018",7,0,0,"It was a great show until they fired Charlie Sheen. I like Ashton Kutcher, but he wasn't a good fit for the part."
"Two men, a house, no adults.","Nov 11, 2006",9,5,6,"*Two And A Half SPOILERS*

When Alan Harper (Jon Cryer), a depressed chiropractic, divorces from his wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) and is thrown out of the house by her, he has to go live with his womanizing, selfish and laid back brother Charlie (Charlie Sheen), who has to 'adapt' to his new roommate, and also to his nephew Jake (Angus T. Jones) who visits every weekend, which basically means to him 'ignoring them'.

And let's not ignore the Matron, Evelyn (Holland Taylor), the woman who has been the cause of Alan and Charlie's problems with adulthood and the other sex, and of their father's suicide (!), and Bertha (Conchata Ferrell), the down-to-earth (sometimes too much) housekeeper who manages to sometimes be the voice of reason, or Rose (Melanie Lynskey), Charlie's stalker, who eventually ends up making friends with Alan, yet keeps on 'trying to demonstrate' her love to Charlie in the most insane (and funny) ways...

Long story short: this sitcom is a gem. And if you don't laugh even once while watching it... get yourself checked.

Two And A Half Men: 9/10."
Ashton ruins it.,"Mar 1, 2021",6,0,1,"You cannot replace legends, yes Ashton Kutcher is an insanely great actor. But the entire series goes from witty comedy to stupid pathetic fart jokes and constant throwing up.. its very dull, I found myself not enjoying the new Two and a half men very much at all. Directors are to blame. Sure new content is hard to create, but come on, constant fart jokes and potty talk breaker this show. Also BRING BACK CHARLIE FFS!!"
9/10 till season 8. Afterwards: 2/10,"Apr 22, 2022",9,2,1,"I am a kind of person who needs closure.

So this review is for similar people like me who are feeling compelled to watch remaining seasons (after S8) for closure.

Due to my Closure seeking nature, Even though many many reviews said to stop when Walden arrives, I thought of giving it a chance.

Just today, I finished all remaining seasons (with lots of skipping/fast-forward), and have to really say it was utter waste of time. Most times I was not laughing at any of the laughing backtrack, it all seemed like forced and silly laughter.

Only saving grace for me giving even 2/10 for later seasons are few occasional episodes featuring Rose.

Barring Rose, everyone else (esp Ashton Kutcher ) sucked ass big time. It was even painful to see worthless inclusions like Michael Bolton, Mila Kunis, Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to forcibly save face of the show at the end. Even the ending is pathetic and appears like Chuck Lorre just wanted to pick bone with Charlie. In final 2 episodes, he even attempts to portray Charlie's role as animated 3D character which fails miserably.

Please please do yourself a big favor and stop watching after Season 8."
The show is just wrong without Charlie,"Jun 17, 2020",7,0,1,The show died without Charlie. It lost the charm. I just couldn't see season 9. They didn't even made it that funny anymore . The jokes were all the same. Had a great start .
Just plain crappy,"Apr 16, 2008",1,33,26,"After reading the current comments that this is the funniest show on TV it just goes to prove that most of American audiences are totally ignorant of what is actually good and what is crap. This show is crap. It was argued that it has a huge audience-well, McDonald's sells the most hamburgers in the US and that don't make them good-they are also crap. The premises are old and the jokes are completely unoriginal-hell, they were using the same lines on the boring Golden Girls fifteen years ago! Real comedy genius(like Frasier, My Name is Earl and Aliens in America) can't be compared to this boring, one dimensional, unfufilling garbage they trowel out week after week-like Everybody loves Raymond which was also a waste of time and the most unoriginal work I've ever seen. Two and a Half and Raymond have not one original joke, plot line or depth, which proves you'll never go broke underestimating American taste-go have a Big Mac."
An introduction to the show,"Apr 27, 2017",7,0,1,"Every individual in the world as a talent which makes them unique and successful.The cliché line everyone just uses to give others a false hope.Why that line was relevant?Well this show is a good example why it's just not that way.Two characters,brothers by birth but are two different sides to the same coin.One is cooler and the other is well he is just dull.One of them is a prime example for the don't care attitude and the other is the example of boring. Wow it seems like i only one of the brothers?Well no,i love both of them its just the dynamic of the show.Let's see how this two brothers ruled television for 8 years shall we?It all begins with the boring brother getting kicked out from his house by his wife for being well boring.He turns to his brother for help and thus begins the world of entertainment. Whose the kid in the background?Well he is the reason the show titled two and a half men.Two brothers and the kid.The writers got it perfect with the title.The punch lines,laughter and everything to be expected from a sitcom is present with the combination of these three on the screen. It would not be that fun to have a show without a sarcastic character who pretty much runs the house in which these three live both metaphorically and literally.She is just an amalgamation of witty quotes,wise comments and sarcasm.When you watch the show just enjoy her presence. The brothers have a lot in difference in between them but one thing that unites them is a person who they hate with a passion.That person was their mother.She is a perfect example of how a mother should never treat her kids.Her actions lead to the change in her kids character.This made one of the kid a drunken womanizer and the other a loser.

This was nominated for the Emmy?,"Feb 3, 2008",4,22,16,"I tried watching a few episodes of this and I had to turn the last episode off before I got to the end. It was that bad. The first bit I watched, where Charlie Sheen pretends that he knows how to surf, used some physical comedy that I sort of liked (he broke a few windows with his board while claiming he was not an idiot). But the jokes in that episode quickly became predictable and just plain not funny. Other jokes are just cheap, just a mention of something sexual or related to bathroom humour. The kid could have written it.

I suppose one of my main reasons for avoiding this show would be that I don't really relate to it. I don't think I've had a brother or roommate who was extremely promiscuous like Charlie Sheen's character. But in general I wouldn't care about these characters. They are uninteresting and two dimensional. I don't understand how this got nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series twice in 2006 and 2007. Because I saw little of it, (only a handful of episodes), I've given it a high failing grade just in case there are actually better episodes, and for the surf board breaking the glass. But it's still a failing grade. I've seen enough."
Going down there,"Feb 27, 2006",N/A,4,2,"I've never gone to the taping of a Sit Com before. Two and a Half Men is definitely worth seeing ""live"".(I'm sure there are some great outtakes we're missing on TV!). I'm going this Friday (March 3rd). I'm hoping Charlie has to do a scene in his underwear, and that this is an episode that includes his real-life Father. Should be fun. Met Jon Cryer at the Emmy Awards last year. Nice guy, but very ""nervous"" (hyper?). Angus T. Jones was hilarious at the People's Choice Awards this year when Ray Romano got him to come up on stage with him (because his own 2 sons refused) and Angus told him ""You're not 'Charlie Sheen' cool"".

"Charlie fanboys stop whining, TAAHM is carrying the same vibe..","Jan 25, 2014",10,2,1,"OK so you were watching Two and a half men because of only Sheen and you don't love the show for what it is?

OK let me state I too was sad when Sheen was fired. I was mostly angry that I won't see a long term and beloved member of the show ever again. I was skeptical what it would turn out to be.

But you know what, Chuck Lorre has done an amazing work at maintaining the quality and uniqueness of the Two and a half men that we have always known and loved. Every character plays their role perfectly. The jokes and situations are natural, effortless and hysterical. Jon Cryer beautifully plays his role as Alan. Ashton Kutcher took a few episodes to get in, he now fits excellently in the show as Walden Schmidt.

I understand your hurt and anger at losing your favourite character, But if you take an unbiased look at Two and a half men now , this is the same show we fell in love with in the first place. Chuck Lorre has not disappointed us a least bit."
The show was stagnant long before Sheen was gone,"Mar 24, 2025",6,0,1,"I recently started watching Two and a Half Men for the first time. I figured a comedy that ran for 12 seasons must be pretty good. After a great first few seasons things started getting stagnant and I found myself googling what season Sheen got fired figuring the show must have got interesting again after that. This was probably around season 6 and he wasn't gone till season nine. I pushed through figuring it must get better to have continued on that long. Season 9 rolled around and things got interesting again for a bit with the Walden character. After awhile it became apparent that the writers really didn't know what to do with Walden and tried to continue on with the same themes earlier in the show that were already dull by now. The storylines just became more awkward. Relationships would just abruptly end with no good filler stories to replace them. Alan's story had already become boring with the same reoccurring theme, but then after Walden came in to play the writers really decided to double down and beat the ""leach"" dead horse even more like that was still funny or had any interest to it left. I don't blame the actors. The writing just got stale and the series should have probably ended much earlier. This is probably more apparent when you watch the series straight through without season breaks. You start seeing how its the same story and humor over and over."

There is a fine line between what is pervert and what becomes cheap, vulgar and disgusting... and two and a half men jumps over that line every now and then. Cracking jokes on a woman's menstrual cycle or on explicit details of the genitals is not at all cool and just plain cheap. I am so glad it is finally off air. I sometimes found it hard to believe that people used to compare this show with FRIENDS..."
Great Funny Show,"Feb 1, 2005",N/A,10,11,"I like the show, it's funny and has a lot of adult humor. Charlie Sheen has reinvented himself. Although at times the character played by John Cryer seems way to wussy and predictable, he can still bring humor to the show with his pathetic life and attempt at scoring or attempts at getting back at his ex-wife. The house keeper brings her own brand of blue collar humor by telling it how it is. The stalker neighbor Rose is there to save the day when the humor is drying up, and who can't be happy with the infinity of babes that come on the show? In addition to this, the fact that they are always trying to dodge their mom is hilarious."
Great show,"Jul 27, 2019",9,2,1,Two and a half men is a great show only with Charlie sheen in it after Charlie left they should've ended it Ashton kutcher was great on that 70s show but not this
A unique comedic take on the dynamic of family,"Feb 17, 2024",7,0,0,"Two and Half Men explores the themes of family, and dark comedy superbly. The earlier seasons with the dynamic of ""two and half men"" was something special and unique to television at the time.

Filled with so many different laughs and expertly wrote lines, the show really does strike gold in the seasons where Angus T Jones is younger. It's a shame the direction the show took due to sheens departure, and bringing Kutcher in wasn't particularly a bad move because he is effortlessly funny in other sitcoms.

Sidelining the family theme was really the shows decline, due to unfortunate circumstances. I think once you lose Sheen and Jones the show really loses what it was originally meant to be. I'd argue some of the earlier seasons were some of the best comedic sitcom episodes to date."
Valuable life lessons from uncle Charlie,"Feb 22, 2021",8,2,1,"This show is an example of how continuing without the main character can kill a show. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher, but also not a hater. But without Sheen TAAHM is just not what it was. For the second time I stopped watching after season 8. My rating is therefor based on the first 8 seasons.

But... there's some true comedy in these seasons. It's not the best writing all the time, but when it's good, it's really good and I can't help thinking that Sheen is just himself all the time.

The hard cynisism between Charlie, Alan, Evelyn and Berta is fantastic and Jake is a great actor. And despite some comments about him getting less funny when growing up... I don't agree. His adolescent behaviour is spot on and adds to the show. His relationship with ""uncle"" Charlie is probably my favorite part of this show, mainly because Sheen is just so non-emphatic with him. The innuendo is great, the constant drinking is hilarious and Cryer grows with every season and is a fantastic actor. Add Berta and Rose to the mix and you have a great comedic cocktail!"
They should have ended the series before the end of Season 7,"Apr 1, 2023",7,0,0,"My rating for the series before Season 7 would have been an 8. My rating for the final four seasons would be a somewhere between 1 and 5. By Season 7 it was evident that the quality of the scripts was deteriorating rapidly, and they should have ended the series at the end of the season. Charlie Sheen quit for whatever reasons after Season 8, and he was the ""smart one"". The fact that the series continued for another four seasons is just further proof of how greedy TV producers are, and any pretense of providing quality entertainment will always take a back seat. The Alan character was always irritating, but counter-balanced by Charlie. Once Charlie was gone, Alan was totally irritating, and the entire premise and situations written for the various characters was preposterous."

Two and a half men,"Oct 11, 2010",1,16,12,"I think i haven't seen worse sitcoms. The background laugh is for every stupid joke they make,weather is funny or not. Really a waste of time. No substance,not relaxing to watch. I have seen quite a few episodes,and their jokes,without the background laugh are just normal ,not funny conversation. was it supposed to be a comedy? Pfff. Other shows are a lot funnier: like King of Queens,and other are funny but are also more relaxing (fun to watch), such as The Bernie Mack Show. This two and a half men,is a lame show,that is probably only made for money,not for a passion,like all the good TV is supposed to be about.I only hope that they wont make any more lame shows like these,and stop this one from running."
One of my favorite funniest TV Shows,"Dec 24, 2021",9,2,1,"I have seen all seasons of the show and I loved it. For me Two and a half men is one of the most funniest tv shows that I have seen together with Big Bang Theory, Friends and How I met your mother.

Jon Cryer who plays Alan in the show did an incredible performance, without him the show would have been only half as good. I am not sure if I would even have watched it without him. I love his role as a scrapepenny who never has much luck with women and always has bad funny things happening to him.

I substracted 1 star because of the last 2 seasons of the show which were pretty boring, unfortunately they weren't so funny compared to the other 10 seasons. Anyway, this is a great funny show and worth watching :)"
Overrated Sitcom That Is Funny But Goes Nowhere,"Aug 21, 2007",6,0,4,"Chuck Lorre is in my opinion a pretty funny writer i was so so with Dharma and Greg, hated Roseanne, and once again i'm so so with Two and A Half Men. It seems though that Lorre is one of those guys that get better and better as they go so i'm looking very forward to The Big Bang Theory this fall on CBS. Now on to the sitcom everyone is hailing as the only worthwhile sitcom on TV for one that is a terrible terrible lie. Two and a Half Men is funny i enjoy it's sexual, crude, but intelligent humour but the show is extremely over rated. The characters do not develop or change or learn lessons and all the show plot wise goes absolutely nowhere every episode is funny but character wise uninteresting. Why Charlie Sheen is viewed as the star is beyond me and why he's up for an emmy is beyond the world because any true fan of the show should be well aware that Jon Cryer is the star. He's definitely the person who generates the best jokes and delivers his lines best he's also the only character who is eccentric or different while the others are very laid back and casual. Charlie Sheen basically just says his lines and he's lucky that they're very good lines or else the show wouldn't be funny. The show is quite entertaining and because of it's go nowhere characters can go on for a long time. Two and a Half Men is really just a bunch of good writers speaking through actors there really isn't anything that makes the characters three dimensional other than Jon Cryer and the boys's mom. From the beginning the show has pretty much only furthered the Alan and his ex wife plot line and not very far at all. I do enjoy the show and find it funny it has it's few classic episodes bu it's never had a ""bad"" episode at least so far and probably because the series is so ho hum that you're expectations aren't big going into it. I think it's one of the most over rated sitcoms in terms of it's constant emmy nominations but it is a huge and hilarious stepping stone for Chuck Lorre who get's better and better as he goes. Overall it's a good show to watch when not much else is on but you won't miss anything if you don't watch it for weeks."
"As ""Sheen"" on TV","Apr 17, 2012",1,8,4,"My ratings of 1 out of 10 is based on frustration of what the creators have done to the show out of pure vanity. I've seen 20 episodes of season 9 and laughed twice. This used to be the best show ever, I could watch episodes over and over again and still laugh. I thought Hollywood is all about business, but Chuck proved me wrong. He destroyed his own masterpiece just to ""Chuck"" out Charlie Sheen, even though the whole show was based on his character. Darn, even his own character is based on that character! Now what's left is ½ of a man. This is now one of the worst sitcoms ever where they resort to using farts and mass vomiting to amuse the audience. We hardly ever see Jake or his grandma, no Judith and Rose... and Ashton, he is just pitiful. Bring Charlie back or end this torture. If you agree, lower your ratings for this criminal act in TV business."

"9 for Sheen, -1 for Kutcher","Mar 19, 2021",9,2,1,"I can only assume Lorre was locked into a contract after Sheen's melt down and just didn't care the final 4 seasons.

During the Sheen years, the chemistry of all the characters was near perfect. It was probably even better when everyone learned Sheen wasn't exactly acting!

Kutcher comes along and it was just pure garbage. Everyone suddenly smokes weed and bangs each other and they just weren't funny about it. It was so bad they had to have certain episodes with Charlie's character or traits tied to it, or Season 11 where they basically just tried to recreate Charlie with a disgusting daughter, a character that was so bad she was gone after 1 season.

We still have the whole show DVR'd on YouTube TV only because we can't single out Sheen's years so we just start over after Season 8. Damn you Charlie and your melt down, it was near perfect!"
i would give 10/10 for first 8 seasons but...,"Sep 8, 2018",7,0,0,The minute they removed Charlie sheen they killed of the show. Chuck Lorre should have thought before doing such decision. Charlie harper living with his brother Alan along with his dumb son was great story line.
Charlie not Walden ...,"Oct 28, 2020",8,2,1,"Great comedy shows. Some seasons / episodes better than others but all worth watching.

Nonetheless, Two and a Half Men without Charlie Sheen is like Van Halen without David Lee Roth or Black Sabbath without Ozzy; just not the real thing!"
Ribald comedy that may be an acquired taste(lessness),"Jul 26, 2023",7,0,0,"Did you know there's a book called Brief Lives of Idiots? It's on my list for future reading. Bet it's a hoot. In the mean time, the Two and a Half Men box-set is keeping me occupied, at least until season eight has run its course. There are four further seasons, sans Sheen, and I'm not sure I can face them. It's been a bit of a dry hump getting as far as I have gotten (season six at time of writing).

Charlie Sheen plays Charlie Harper, a rich jingle writer with a Malibu beach house and a lustlife to be envied. His depraved bachelor serenity is shattered by the arrival of his poorer, unprepossessing younger brother, Alan (Jon ""Ducky"" Cryer). Then there's Alan's son, Jake (Angus T. Jones) there on the weekends. This is an odd couple relationship that is mutually beneficial, Charlie becoming slightly more civilised and Alan getting to live in 'Paradise'. Throw in the continual appearance of Charlie's surly housekeeper, Berta, his stalker, Rose, and the brothers' detested mother, Evelyn, and you have the recurring cast. Oh, let's not forget Alan's vengeful soon-to-be ex-wife, Judith, and a long conga line of floosies. T&AHM, a sitcom about sex and not getting any.

For that really is what it is about. I guess to a degree it is about parenthood and divorce, but the abiding theme is fornication. Credit to the writers, they get seasons worth of comedy mileage out of every possible innuendo. Variations on a comedic situation you might call it, but one with little development; bit like Charlie's music career. Still, they try. The season five CSI-themed episode is hilarious, and I never saw CSI. Sheen's character, Charlier Harper, remains stubbornly, irritatingly likeable, despite his gross selfishness and impossible lucky streak. He's lucky in every aspect of life, in contrast to Alan who is his own worst enemy. As for Jake, there's an integrity to his stupidity that one has to ultimately respect. It protects him, like armour.

Problem is, where other sitcoms achieve a balance of episodic stories with a long term development of the characters' situation, their relationships and life events, T&AHM is content to sit on its deckchair and sip its whisky, looking at the ever present, unchanging ocean surface. Women come, women go, but Charlie and Alan remain just where they are, unchanging. None of them change much. Rose stays a fruit loop, the mother is a devoted b****, Berta is wryly acerbic, and Jake switches merely from naivety to outright stupidity. Alan never recovers from terminal pratfalling and Charlie remains trapped in a loop of meaningless one-night stands. Even when he attempts a serious commitment, we know the writing's on the wall (sprayed all over the linens).

And then came the break. Sheen was dumped out of the show and replaced at Charlie's Malibu lust nest by Aston Kutcher's super-rich dot com entrepreneur. No connection with Alan and Jake, but for some unaccountable reason they stay on with him. It's a truism that all American shows outstay their welcome; the networks are truly venal and can't let go. Four more seasons of T&AHM sans Sheen? You only need read the reviews here on IMDB to know what audiences made of that. Troubling in a way, for it just goes to show that we were all in cahoots with Charlie the whole time. Despite his deplorable behaviour, his professional laziness, his refusal to change, we were all on his side, never on Alan's. It's a lesson, one that should make us reconsider our own priorities, our own selfish desires, and maybe watch another, smarter sitcom instead.

Now where's the Frasier dvd box-set..."
I had same opinion but....,"Mar 4, 2021",10,2,1,I never saw season 9 knowing Charlie left. But recently I saw 1-12 seasons and it's not bad. You can watch and Ashton did his best. There is no comparison between Charlie and Ashton. But I would say watch it before you make an opinion.
This stumbling zombie of a show needs to be decapitated,"Jun 11, 2012",1,9,5,"I was watching a rerun of the first two ever episodes of TAAHM, 'Pilot' and 'Big Flappy Bastards' and in the middle of enjoying these classic episodes remembered that I had given this show a rating of 10 back in the good old days of Charlie Sheen.

That had to be rectified, as immediately after these reruns a new TAAHM episode was shown with Ashton Kutcher and as I watched this sorry excuse for a comedy, I experienced a mixture of revulsion, sorrow, disgust and anger.

So here I am, to formally drop my rating from a 10, right down to a 1.

This show has nothing going for it. It's a stumbling zombie of a comedy devoid of anything remotely funny about it."
Needs to have Charlie,"Dec 22, 2019",9,2,1,This was 10/10 with charlie sheen but 6/10 without him. That's really all you need to know.
WTF Were They Thinking?,"Apr 15, 2014",1,4,1,"Ah, this show. I remember it as one of my favorites as a kid, I watched it more than many others. Jon Cryer, Angus T. Jones, and Charlie Sheen are one of the best comedic trios I know. But then, IT came. The 9th season premiered and i was so upset when i found out they got rid of Charlie, and replaced him with Aston Kutcher. I got over it after a while, and Aston i thought was.... OK, not great but, OK ""at least Alan and Jake are still here"" i thought. And when things couldn't get worse that season, Jake leaves to go to the army. Now there's just Alan and that other guy, who i don't and would rather not know who he is! For those of you who are watching this show for the first time, take my advice. Give up at the end of the 8th season. Lest you wish to witness a great disappointment you'll never forget."
Not bad. This sitcom is not entirely dead but after a few shows we get it,"Dec 10, 2005",N/A,6,7,"Charlie Sheen is of course all tabloids favorite target, except maybe Robert Downey, Jr. and to say that he has made spectacular movies since his Oliver Stone days is an insult to his intelligence (which I have no idea on what level that is) and what can you do with an actor who basically resembles a still photograph - I mean that. There is not a single expression on his face that in any way looks like he is a living person.

Since all sitcoms revolve around a hook, this is fairly unoriginal. It looks like the later sitcoms past the year 2000 have recycled ideas that were not really that new in the 1960's. So in fact we get a mix between the odd couple (Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, who plays his brother although I think that Emilio would have been better if the character had been turned into a slob a la Oscar Madison) and the ""Friends"" angle (Joey and Chandler) although Sheen had done this way before Matt LeBlanc even was a name you had seen once in the end credits of TV guest stars.

Add Holland Taylor to that mix (I have no freak-in' idea how many series she has appeared in but it's gotta be two figures if not three) and you have a nice, occasionally funny, but not really that memorable sitcom as has been the case with virtually all of them after reality shows ate up all prime time.

So there you have it. Another movie actor turned to TV and made digestible for the masses and not much more."
A Masterpiece Ruined,"Oct 19, 2021",10,2,1,"(The rating is only because of Charlie Sheen until Season 8, Episode 16) This was a very great sitcom with memorable funny moments... Until Charlie Sheen was on the show.

After that it's an insult to the fans.

I honestly don't know how to rate this because of the insult I have received after watching the Finale.

I watched until Season 8, Episode 16 (Last Episode with Charlie) and then knew what a fiasco the rest of the show had become and even then I made the mistake to only watch the Finale.

And I thought How I Met Your Mother's Finale was the worst thing possible!

What a waste of potential and greatness to be ruined by the utmost childish grudge of Chuck Lore. He wanted to disrespect Charlie with the Finale but he disrespected the whole fan base of this show.

Charlie Sheen and the rest of the cast get full rating from me but after him being fired, the show gets 0.

To the people who want to start watching this: Watch until Charlie Sheen is on the show and then turn it off and be happy with all the funny and great memories. Don't make the mistake I did in watching the Finale. And most importantly, don't watch anymore of Chuck Lore's Productions.

Thank you Charlie Sheen for all the memories."
Till season 8 it's topclass.,"Dec 24, 2018",10,1,0,After season 8 the show deserves 1 out of 10 stars. My 10 star review is only for Charlie Sheen and nothing else. Hatsoff to Charlie Sheen and his brilliance 🙏 I admired and respected his character the day i started watching the show. Without Charlie Sheen the show is just useless and pathetic.
An awesome sitcom that will stand the test of time.,"May 16, 2023",10,1,0,"Everything was jolly good until Charlie was fired. I still remember his last scene where he saw Rose's made up Manne Quine husband and still didn't figure out the plot.

Every actor has demons to deal with in their personal lives. And sometimes it reflects on their workplace. That doesnt mean you have to fire the icon of your franchise.

A poor decision from Lorre that basically sealed the fate of this awesome series down to the gutter.

And Charlie's ending was so disrespectful. Followed with constant disrespect on his intellectual as an individual as well as an actor.

Thanks to Chuck's personal grudge, we are robbed from a well deserving ending of ""Two and a half man"".

FYI, l stopped watching ""Two and a half man"" right after they killed him."
WAS a good show,"Nov 5, 2018",4,4,1,With Charlie it was a good show. But with Ashton Kutcher it really sucked.
Deserves a mixed score,"Apr 16, 2022",8,1,0,Two and a Half Men deserves a mixed score. An 8 for Charlie Sheen and a 5 for Ashton Kutcher. Ironically the same situation occurred on Spin City when Michael J Fox left and Charlie Sheen came in. When you replace the starring character the show drops off cause it's not the same. There was no chemistry between Ashton and Jon.
"The story of 5 seasons: Charlie bangs chicks. Whoo whoo. Plot of 6 & 7 seasons: Charlie wants to bang just one chick..! Yaay.. Overrated, pathetic sitcom","Apr 23, 2010",2,18,16,"I must admit that I got hooked to this show when I was an impressionable teen. I mean Charlie had the life, having sex with random hot babes and drinking and living like a slob. Really, every man's dream is to be like Charlie. I liked it as it was funny with lots of adult humor and had lots and lots of hot girls. But after 3 seasons watching it on TV, I got bored. Which young guy could get bored by a sitcom having sex as its main theme?!! Then I started watching 'Friends', 'How I Met Your Mother' and 'The Big Bang Theory' which are infinitely more funny and smarter than this. My friend said I would like the 6th season as Charlie has found one woman to be with the rest of his life. But I still didn't like it as it all seems so forced.

Charlie sheen treating women as sex objects and corrupting his young nephew through his promiscuous ways is very sad. Promiscuous is a very good term, no he is a slut, a man-whore, an a**hole. And his brother Alan is very irritating and unfunny. All he does is get divorced and give the girls alimony. The little boy, Jake was very likable in the first two seasons, then he was only tolerable for me. The only character I like even now is Berta, the housekeeper. The brother's mother is also like a bitch in heat. This show tells us that none of the females have any dignity or self-respect. If you like that moral, then you'll immensely enjoy the show.

The screenwriters are probably some nerds who hit the jackpot when the producer gave the thumbs up for this. They would have been rolling around on the ground laughing their brains out when their dream of having hot girls remove their clothes came true. Charlie is the exact type of guy our society doesn't need. He is like that even in real life. What I find very disturbing is the fact that he has gained immense wealth and popularity doing what he normally does (sleep around). He cannot act for God's sake. All he has are three expressions which he recycles over and over again. Speaking of which, why the hell would they produce canned laughter in the background when there is nothing remotely funny in the scene. Those who have given this a 10 need to check their brains, as they have said this is a smart show. This isn't smart or enjoyable. This is nothing short of disgraceful to men and women. Neither is everyone a jerk like Charlie, nor does every girl want to sleep with a guy just because he is rich and famous, or handsome.

How can this show be nominated for the Emmy Awards? That is not a good sign. It is really disheartening to see that other better shows are being taken off the air when this is still getting high ratings. This sitcom has overstayed its welcome. May it burn to the ground at least now. For the first two seasons which I liked;

who sings the theme song??,"Mar 13, 2006",N/A,3,2,"Where does it say for certain who sings the theme song? Especially with the long version, it sounds like Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus. On one of the websites, it lists Bernadette Peters--was this for the old version? My husband and I have a weekly disagreement on this topic. Can anyone point me to where I can find out for sure?

This show is GREAT. We laughed for the whole episode when Alan felt that Jake was growing away from him. Having the mother run away from the sleepover was classic--haven't we all felt that way? Didn't really care for the ending of the last episode, when Alan and Candy came in to the party. Think they could've come up with a better line."
only the charlie episodes,"Apr 23, 2022",8,1,0,"Ashton has made a career out of living off scraps of better actors. The chemistry of the first 8 seasons is priceless. After that, it is unwatchable. Much like the first 5 seasons of mom or big bang theory."
What's left to say?,"Jun 2, 2024",8,1,0,"I've watched this series a few times up until Charlie Sheen left the show, and just recently watched the last four seasons with Ashton Kutcher. I am in the agreement with some other viewers who believe the show should have ended at season eight. There is nothing wrong with that. Eight seasons is plenty before a show starts to wear out it's welcome.

The show started out to be humorous and heart warming when Jake was young, and slowing evolved into Charlie and Alan's antics. That is fine as well, but it's unfortunate that they made Jake into the teenageer with a poor attitude trope when they could have evolved his character as well.

Most episodes after Charlie Sheen left were just ridiculous and all over the place while introducing new characters that were pointless not to mention just unlikable. The last two episode finale was outright silly with the animation, the jabs at Sheen and too many not so inside jokes and breaking the fourth wall. A disappointing ending."
After Charlie Sheen left I lost my appetite,"Oct 7, 2020",5,5,2,Charlie Sheen was the heart of this show and after he left it becomes a laughing stock. The creator's should have ended the show with him dying. I would've rated the show 9/10
Funny,"May 19, 2023",8,1,0,"I like this show a lot. It does not get the credit it deserves. One thing I hate is comedy snobbery. I like smart comedy and dumb comedy. Funny is funny. Two And A Half Men might be a mainstream sitcom but I don't care because it makes me laugh. It is a documentary about Charlie Sheen and his nice dorky brother and his big dopey son Jake. They live in Beverly Hills Miami or something and date lots of beautiful women. My favourite by far is Kandi who is a beautiful young bimbo. The theme song is funny too. I haven't seen the whole show yet and apparently it gets worse near the end, but I like what I have seen so far."
Four Words: Bring Back Charlie Now!,"Sep 8, 2022",1,5,2,"I'm going to have to agree 100% with Three Words post. Charlie is Two and a Half Men and to dump a filler in his place was like dropping a dump truck into a small boat. Sinks like a Rock! I'm not much of an Ashton Kutcher fan, but he was the anchor that sunk that ship. Charlie has the balls the pull that character off in the perfect way and brought balance to the show so it wasn't so one sided with John (Allen). Lets face it you can't have a Devil Dog with no creme. Bringing Ashton Kutcher to replace Charlie Sheen was like bringing another John to the show. When I think of Two and a Half Men, I just want the episodes with Charlie and that is it. I would have just ended the show when Charlie was put out."
Give us back the old Charlie,"Sep 15, 2009",N/A,3,2,"I think that Chuck Lorre is a genius. I loved ""2 and 1/2 man"" and maybe even more ""The big bang theory"". Characters have been always various and perfectly designed, showing a great psychological knowledge of different humanity. But............ I super-loved Charlie from the first episode of the first year and I'm crazy for Alan, but............ what the hell happened to the real Charlie in the 6th season? Charlie is not Charlie anymore. Now he is REALLY stupid (before he was not, only apparently superficial, actually a super-cool guy) he is becoming an Alan copy, he fall in love for an annoying classical woman, egoist and full of request, he even gave her an engagement ring and he is still with her after an entire season. This is not the Charlie we know. Where are the gorgeous women he was used hang with in the past seasons? If I want to see the sad love stories of every day it is enough for me watching my loser friends with their pathetic fiancees. I loved the series as it was and this changing has been very delusional for me and my ""2 and half men"" watching buddies. Chuck, please, Give us back the old Charlie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Miro Viglianesi"
"Not great, not bad","Dec 1, 2020",8,1,0,"Two and a Half Men was never a great show. Not even with Charlie Sheen. It was usually funny, but not always. But it also never had any of the cringeworthy annoying characters/jokes that plague a lot of other sitcoms, so it was always enjoyable to watch even if it wasn't actually making you laugh. Even after Sheen's departure, it continued to be funny even if it was filled with narrative flaws.

Most of the show's issues arose in the Ashton Kutcher era, but none were his fault. I don't understand the digs that many people are making against his acting, nor the disdain they suddenly have for the sexual jokes that were just as much of a mainstay on the original seasons as the latter episodes. The problems came primarily with the lack of consistent supporting characters. First they lost Sheen, then Jake, Judith, and Evelyn's appearances became rare. Then there's an endless parade of love interests for Ashton. Any one of them could have been a good recurring character but the writers were unwilling to commit. His mother and ex wife go from regular characters to nonexistent. Rose goes from a major character to an afterthought. He has multiple girlfriends that vanish for silly reasons. Amber Tamblyn was a wonderful character, but despite living in the same house as them, she frequently is missing from episodes without explanation, then becomes a total afterthought once she moves out. They adopt a kid who is conveniently missing all the time. Kutcher randomly takes a strange computer nerd under his wing for a season, then he vanished without a trace. They were supposed to launch a new tech empire together, but I guess that never happened. The writers just constantly toss new ideas at a wall and none of them stick for long, leaving a tangled mess of loose ends that are never resolved. The series finale wasn't great but they made the most they could of it by repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and acknowledging the mess they made.

Two and a Half Men was never going to be a GREAT sitcom because it wasn't smart like Seinfeld or emotionally-driven like Friends or HIMYM. The characters were likable but not lovable. Their situations were humorous but not hilarious or memorable. It was never going to be great. It probably could have been a lot better than it was had Sheen not had a meltdown. They did okay in the latter seasons, all things considered. It's not a must-watch series by any means, but it will rightfully live on for another twenty years in syndication and remains perfectly re-watchable."
9/10,"Jun 29, 2021",10,0,0,"Just giving 9/10 because it wasn't as good when Ashton came. I liked Sheen more.

It's a really good comedy show, really funny.

I just don't like Rose, she's annoying."
8/10 for season1-8,"May 28, 2020",8,1,0,"In fact I'm inclined to give a 7, which of course is still for S1-8. But eventually I think the show is still good in general.

As someone who's seen his fair share of sitcoms, I always insist that when it comes to evaluate a sitcom, hilarious and enduring jokes and other content is not the sole prerequisite. A good sitcom must have good values and virtues. They're the soul of the sitcom, without which the show would go down a slippery slope and eventually reeks of moral ambiguity.

Before I write this review, I read some of the existing reviews, most of which consider Charlie Sheen the backbone of the show and I agree. Some feel sorry for the character Alan Harper, who didn't deserve being belittled all the time. Some think the show encouraged disrespectful stereotypes and made bad jokes about sensitive social problems. And the elephant in the room would be Charlie Sheen's departure, which was also linked to his questionable life issues.

And that is exactly what I'm talking about. This show has too many questionable contents, and it would appear a lot of real life issues leaked into the show, which was supposed to be a safe haven away from the dark ugliness. Without a right direction, no matter how hilarious the show is, that's all it could be, and nothing more profound.

I absolutely enjoyed watching this show, but sadly it was polluted by toxic creating environment and the complexity of real life."
What?,"May 31, 2011",3,8,5,"I have never understood the appeal of this show. But then, I am not its target audience. My brother in law thinks it's the funniest thing since comedy was invented. And he normally hates comedy! The difference between us is that he is a public school teacher with an incredibly juvenile sense of humor. He thinks like an 8 year old, in other words. I love raunch when handled properly. But I find this show simply to be a knockoff of ""The Odd Couple"" for juvenile-minded males who snigger at endless boobies and poopy jokes. Sheen plays a mindless womanizer (what else is new?) and I find the fat nephew repellent. Cryer is just lucky to have a job. He has always been a sort of poor man's Matthew Broderick. Watch at your own peril."

He has it in the left arm. The nurse says make sure to give that arm plenty of exercise. Alan then says darn, maybe it should have been in the right arm! Crowd then breaks out in laughter knowing what Alan meant!

Here is an opportunity they missed on Two and Half Men. Here is a much better ending when Jake goes to his first boy girl party and is interested in a certain girl. Jake wants to know what to do and both Charlie and Alan give him some things he should do. Both Charlie and Alan after the party are waiting for Jake in the car. When Jake gets into the car they ask Jake how it went. Then Jake says smell my finger!"
"Too Much Sex Humor, Not Enough Creativity","Jan 13, 2009",5,8,5,"At the risk of sounding like an old fuddy-duddy, I'll try to be hip and fair in my review.

Watched my first full episode of TAAHM last night. On the plus side, the show benefits greatly from the very skilled direction of Andy Ackerman (Seinfeld, Becker and - one of my all-time faves - Wings, among others). The acting was credible and the story interesting enough.

On the down side, I found the writing to rely too heavily on sexual humor. Let me re-phrase that: on overtly sexual humor.

I'm as prone as any guy to laugh at a boob or masturbation joke. The problem is, this show seems to never let up on the frequency of the jokes and goes for the cheap shot (i.e. the writers got lazy and took the easy road) at the expense of creativity.

To prove my point, watch ""The Contest"" episode of Seinfeld. I challenge anyone here to tell me they've laughed harder at a TAAHM than the brilliance that was ""The Contest"".

IMHO, well-written innuendo is far funnier.

I do really like the theme song...very catchy!"

I find this one of the (if not THE) funniest, best written comedy on the air right now. I never miss a show. I really have no problem with Jake hearing about all of Charlie's escapades...come on now, it's 2006!! Berta is hilarious (glad to see her back..last time I saw her was in Mystic Pizza) and I really like Taylor.

"Mediocrity sells, does it not?","Nov 9, 2012",1,6,3,"Gay jokes or toilet humour are rarely funny, and that is no exception on this show. There are so many one-liners and copycat bits that miss totally. The jokes don't even seem like jokes, the script is boring, and Ashton's character is unoriginal and uninteresting. He's just a typically exaggerated sitcom personality which is totally unrealistic. I think they actually want us to fantasize about being someone like him, but why? The show never really was that creative but Charlie was sloppy and entertaining. Allen is the only remotely comical character now, which doesn't say much about the rest of the show. It reminds me of 'Man Up' - a total train-wreck which contained zero comedy. The only thing it was missing was a laugh track. Anyway, who finds this stuff funny? People with head trauma?

Perhaps I've grown tired of this genre. It just seems like the writing is desperate and lazy, and feels like the show was flung together for money only. I sense zero artistic merit and all I can do is shake my head and cock my eyebrow. It doesn't seem genuine. The characters are just running through the motions. The characters are enthusiastic and high-strung and perhaps compensating for how empty they are. Their actions and gestures actually make me anxious and annoyed. The best word I can use to describe the new 2 1/2 Men is lame. I still watch it, but I can't help but pick every minute apart because it's just a bunch of awkwardly unfunny scenes, one after the other.

I can't wait until Arrested Development comes back. Yes, I realize it's the complete opposite of 2 1/2 Men, and I know we watch 2 1/2 Men because of the goofy immaturity - not to be enlightened, but TV really needs some smart comedy before our sense of humour disappears. The garbage that's coming out is only lowering the bar for the next pile of drivel. The writer's aren't artistic or funny. They're machines which process bits from other comedies which got good ratings, because they're too afraid to take risks. They only want what they know will sell. The idiots rule TV, both as viewers and creators. Give us shows that takes risks like Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. At least they're trying to write something fresh that gives us perspective rather than the same old, same old. Cancel this show."
Changes,"Aug 21, 2023",9,1,0,"This is an interesting series. It started off with great potential for more complex relationships especially between Charlie and Evelyn. But after the first season, their relationship was based on mutual animosity with no regards to any deeper feelings.

The character arc of Charlie was well done as he moved through professions and tried to have adult relationships. Jake was fantastic and was very cunning and insightful, it's too bad they dumbed down his character.

Alan never really saw the spotlight until Walden replaced Charlie. It was nice to see Alan as a co-lead.

The last season with Charlie wasn't good-it was forced without any resolution.

The reviews for each episode after Walden arrived tanked and I think that it was unfair. I think the writers did well by bringing in the ""anti"" Charlie so to speak.

The final episode had the worst rankings but I thoroughly enjoyed it as I like fourth walk breaks.

Great show, though a little over the top on the sexual references."
Schmidt-stained,"Nov 6, 2012",1,7,4,"Charles left ;(, and the show lost its appeal. I think Lorre should have just apologized, and saved his show from the crap it is now. Even the writings gone horrible.I thought I'd still watch it, you know? to see how the characters develop. But it's like all the actors lost their light. Kutcher keeps playing Kelso, who wasn't even funny in ""That 70's Show"".

The show blows, the network should just chuck, Lorre.

Now you can find Charlie on ""Anger Management"" still doing his thing. The Series first few lines say it all ""You can't fire me, I quit!, think you can replace me with some other guy? go ahead, it won't be the same. You may think i'm losing, I'm not, I'm......""

WE MISS CHARLIE."
The Best Thing On TV,"Mar 30, 2006",N/A,2,1,"This show is the funniest sitcom on the box by far. At the moment in the UK series 2 is running every week day night on channel 5. 5 episodes a week, oh heavenly joy. I just hope that this doesn't mean they have abandoned it to the tea time slot because no one else watches it, and then don't bother buying the 3rd series. Any UK viewer reading this that hasn't seen it you are missing a treat. Fabulous Fabulous show. I love it. The show is very adult but done in such a brilliantly subtle way that the kids could watch it to without a problem. If you are missing Friends and Frasier, this is the perfect show for you. Great Characters, perfect timing, laugh a minute script, gorgeous women, what more could you possibly ask for."
A life time of watching,"Sep 20, 2022",10,1,0,"I keep watching all seasons again and again and enjoying It's the magic formula of comedy and romance.

Love each of them and how things change all the way but still main story goes on.

Definitely my favorite tv show ever along side with how I met your mother Every character in the show has a story and depth in personality that makes the story unique It's simply life ups and downs in a comedy frame , would be really great if we can see more good shows like that From season 1 till last season the story can't be much better than they done Sending love and respect for everyone behind the camera who made it looks very interesting each episode."
The brilliance is in the writing and execution...,"Jan 31, 2009",10,4,5,"Charlie is a care-free guy who writes jingles and lives on the royalties that he makes until one day his easy life style is thrown out of the window when his brother Alan moves in with his son, Jake.

Charlie Sheen is brilliantly funny as the womaniser who can easily bed women with a cheesy line, he makes you laugh out loud while Jon Cryer has impeccable timing and his facial features only add as a great comedic bonus.

The show is a little formulaic almost always focusing on Charlie's exploits as a romancer but the show holds its own with some great witty dialogue and dry wit....

A show that will have you laughing until your sides hurt!"
I have never laughed so hard.,"Sep 23, 2008",10,3,3,"I began watching Two and a Half Men at the beginning of this year after catching some of the reruns, and I can say in all honesty that this show is the funniest I have ever seen.

It makes me laugh out loud every time I watch an episode, and I never have found myself yawning over weary dialogue or lame jokes.

Excellent writing, coupled with superb acting and a constant flow of supporting characters that add laughs and twists make this show something very special--something that we all hope will last a long time.

I consider myself to be a big movie fan, and I am also a considerably harsh critic of all types of television and movies. Truly entertaining comedy sitcoms are especially rare, and therefore I feel fortunate to able to enjoy a show whose entertainment value has not decreased since I begun watching it."
Again we're submitted to terrible American comedy.,"Mar 11, 2011",1,7,4,"Once again we're submitted to terrible American comedy.

It is entirely boring and repetitive with the same jokes reused every week. I couldn't tell one episode from another as every week its the same old sexual innuendo jokes and one liners over and over..

The set, the actors and every aspect of the show is so shiny and polished I'm surprised the actors can see one and other without getting blinded, The laughter track needed to prompt people into knowing when the show is meant to be ""funny"" makes you feel violated by forced humour.

I'm so happy it is cancelled and the I hope the reruns will be also see the shelf as well so I can once again not fear having to turn on my TV and seeing one of Sheens horrible shirts.

Please American TV networks stop making comedy, you're terrible at it."

I dig this show,"Feb 7, 2016",N/A,1,0,"This is what I watch when I want to de-stress. It's a simple straight forward funny sitcom. Charlie Sheen is perfectly cast as the lovable rascal, Charlie Harper. I suspect the TV show may have actually been written for him.

It's basically just an updated version of The Odd Couple; Charlie is the womanizing drunken slob, while Alan is the fastidious Mama's boy that is perennially shocked by his older brothers's sordid lifestyle.

The straight man and the foil.

It's a simple formula that works as well here as it has ever done - Martin and Lewis, Randall and Klugman, Lemmon and Matthau. The supporting players this time around are uniformly excellent. A Tony Award winning Housekeeper, A cute kid, a harem load of some very hot Women, more alcohol to drown a paddock and an embittered salaciously saucy controlling Mother and you have one of the greatest ever TV shows."
The funniest show on Television theses days !,"Sep 16, 2008",8,4,6,"I found this series on DVD, i was like, it got the most entertaining guy in movies, Charlie Sheen, so I buy it but with low expectations, i didn't know it was doing well in the states.. then I found it have 6 seasons ! I'm at season 4, and I can't get enough of it ! Me and my girlfriend sit at home one night watching this... we end watching the whole season 1 in less than a weekend !

Charlie Sheen (as Charlie Harper) & Jon Cryer (as Alan Harper) are two brothers, and Alan have a son named Jake (Augus T. Jones), Alan split with his wife and come to live in the house of his brother, but he will not like that at first, because he's a womanizer and he likes to keep his house clean. There are also secondary characters such as Bertha (a very funny housewife, Conchata Farrell), Rose (a one night stand affair and she keep coming and see him, so funny), as well as their mother (Holland Taylor, a rich and snobbish women that her sons will do anything not to see her, specially Charlie).

All in all, a fantastic show, brilliant story lines, every episode have something new, some people will think it will go dumb with the time, and it's the truth, and that's what we like, you will be entertain a lot and it's so easy to watch, an episode is like 22 minutes ! I hope a movie is in their minds because it's truly the funniest thing on television that do more dramatic-action series theses days !"
A pure CBS hit!,"Jul 28, 2006",9,3,4,"""TWO AND A HALF MEN,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. One of my favorites would have to be the episode where Jodi Lyn O'Keefe guest-stars. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off CBS, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good."
AMAZING & DELIGHTFUL..... Love this show for the sake of Laugh......!!!!!!!!,"Oct 23, 2009",10,3,4,"I love this show! It's an amazing mix of dirty humour and amusing 'real life' situations. It's very enjoyable for a laugh and some fun! The entire show appears to be dedicated to making the audience laugh at the character's dilemmas and it is very amusing to see how everyone's situation entwines and makes into a large but hilarious plot! The entire cast is very amusing and their voices, attitudes, appearances and body language portray their characters to their full potential.And Specially i like the Uncle Charlie,what an outstanding performance by the him......!!!!! I DEFINITELY recommend that you watch this show. At least watch several episodes to get a taste of it. I can almost definitely guarantee you'll be hooked!"
Webster has now two new definitions for lame...,"Feb 21, 2015",1,5,3,"First is Chuck Lorre, so self centered he pretends he was the reason for the series success, not Charlie Sheen;

Second is last episode(s) of this once a good series, before Charlie left it; How this asshole managed to put down this series is beyond believable!

I am sure he's rich now...

And still it makes a new definition for rich: ANY IDIOT TV business who wins millions being a jerk!

Is That a new definition for jerk as well? ;)

Making it short: as soon as Charlie left, and that pseudo actor came in, keeping the ones just willing to get some money still in, it sinked royally!

Am I the only only one who thinks that?

Am I the only one to post the Truth in here?

Is that Chuck Lorre that powerful he can stop people posting on IMDb?

I really hope not, he's just as lame as lame gets!"
the show is dead,"Oct 17, 2011",8,3,4,"I hope that the producer's greed will die someday. It's like we keep a men on the dead bed with the perfusion, pills, mechanical lung or cardiostimulator. The show is dead, long live the show. Or it's its lenght, or the lack of any new ideas, or the missing character but the show is dead. Maybe with Charlie Sheen it was a chance but now it's nothing than a collection of garbage, Charlie is good for this kind of job, Ashton is just a moron trying to wear some pants not made for him, and by the way Ashton was never funny, is just a way he try to act but is always the same, not funny, not clever, not deep, just pretty dumb and that's all he got! As for the producers, I hope that you will be bankrupt, it will be a lesson for you, the show is dead without Charlie and now that he is dead maybe is the moment for you to wake up, as a conclusion 8 years on a show could be enough, maybe is time to find fresh ideas!"
From hilarious to irritating,"Jul 8, 2013",3,5,3,"The show from being a blockbuster turned into an utter disaster in a span of just one episode. Well, what was missing?? The witty and inevitable Charlie Sheen. With John Cryer trying desperately to keep up the essence of the show, Ashton Kutcher is killing it. To top that, Angus Jones(Jake) is almost removed. And c'mon, he's not ""half"" any more!!

With excessive effort, I managed to complete the 9th season and the writers are planning on an 11th season now... Have they completely lost it?? Shame on them for completely ruining one of the best TV comedy shows.

I must say, without Charlie's subtle and raunchy jokes the show is a total waste. Either bring back Charlie or please stop this madness."
Is it really that bad?,"Sep 6, 2012",9,2,2,"Let's Face it, it is not the same as it was with Charlie Sheen, but is it really that bad? This is not a one man show, and every character have contributed one way or another to create moments of enjoyment for us, it is not only Charlie absent that reduced the quality of the show!, for instance, where is ""Rose"" the funniest stalker that I ever seen? Beside we have seen Charlie recently in ""Anger Management"" is he the same Charlie that we used to love, and supposedly he continued in ""Two & half men"" would his role as a handsome, rich playboy would be accepted especially after the way he looks right now (aged several years, lost a lot of weight and only God knows if he still using). Come on guys I love Charlie too but that does not give me the right to insult the hard works of every person contributed to this show. The bottom line is, yes it is not the same, I love Charlie, I love every character in the show and it is still funny and better than many other comedy that is airing right now.less"
10 until the season 8,"Jun 1, 2018",10,2,2,I'm just gonna pretend that they didn't fire Charlie and gonna give a 10 for 8 wonderful seasons. Three other seasons you can ignore folks!
Best Comedy Since FRIENDS,"Jun 22, 2011",8,2,2,"Two and a half men is the best comedy in a long time. Charlie Sheen is a great actor, and Angus T. Jones does a wonderful portrayal of a lazy preteen (Jake). John Cryer's character is as funny as Charlie. Not to mention the side characters, such as Rose, Berta, and Evelyn, who are also extremely funny. Rose's constant stalking of Charlie or ""monkey man"" as she calls him, always cracks m up, so does Berta's sarcasm. Jake, who is always lazy and oblivious brings something else to show that doesn't revolve around sex, but what it is like to grow up in todays society. Alan (Cryer) is a Obsessive neat freak, and the complete opposite of his brother. So what if there are sexual jokes, grown up and deal with it, because they are still funny."
This show sucks!!! Charlie Sheen sucks!!!!,"Sep 18, 2012",1,5,3,"Half of each show takes place in Charlie Sheen's bedroom with the same old dilemma time after time: I just banged another chick, now how do I get ride of her. Can't these writers come up with anything new or interesting?? The jokes are cheap, child-like, and after one or two all the too predicable.

It is baffling that Sheen's character is getting laid at all by anyone, let alone by hot chicks left and right. Besides his character being affluent what does he have going for him? Sheen has gotten really creepy looking over the years. He is not a good looking guy at all. In every episode he wears the same thing: loafers, knee high tube socks, khaki shorts, and the bowling shirt. Give me a break man. Not to mention when he approaches women in the episodes and is trying to give them game or pickup lines or be charming it comes off unbelievable. The way he talks to a woman and his mannerisms while doing so reek of insecurity as Sheen is insecure himself. Obviously he is acting like himself in real life 'cuz it is sort of his show. So he is dressing himself and acting himself. Sheen's character is boring and has no emotional range. Same episode him drinking beer or talking about sex. ZZZZZ.

In fact all the characters are unlikeable. Cryer is a total nerd and is whining or complaining about something endlessly. If he doesn't like his brother then move out.

It is not worth talking about more. I am not a fan of Ashton Kutcher but he could not possibly be any less funny than Sheen. Glad Sheen is gone and am baffled the show is still being aired."
I can't stop laughing.. it's so funny,"Jan 15, 2019",10,2,2,Oh man.. this show has a special place in my heart. Up until season 8 everything was all roses and flowers. So we're going to focus on that. I feel like it won't age for many decades to come. What I most like about is its rapid fire rate of jokes. Each episode has many many many jokes. So much so that my jaw hurts after watching it continuously for a while.. simply because it's so damn funny.. like I can't stop laughing at it. And that's why I love it. I love the characters. The stage. The music. The plot. I love it all. To me this is a genuine masterpiece
What a crap after season 8 it was...,"Oct 26, 2012",1,5,3,"It was one of the Best ever Series until Charlie (Sheen) fought the writers... Then Charlie (Harper) was killed and crap started. From episode 1 on season 9 they made sure Charlie would have to be buried. And invited a lot of wanna be actors/actresses to join the er show.

Well, Zoey made it edible, in a sense, for season 9. Amongst all bad acting and overacting even from the former well known characters/actors. I'd guess some highly regret it! Or, not at all, as long as it is Hollywood.

But season 10 is not worth watching at all — the writers are lost and just come in with nonsensical plots like threesomes with Alan (?!?!?!) and Rose again stalking and crap like that. It ended on season 8 and everything after that just made that nice actress who does Zoey stand up.

Ridiculous waste of time!

Stay out!

What was a 8 or 9 stars sitcom is now 1 or 2 at best."
i like what i've seen so far,"Feb 18, 2006",N/A,1,0,"This is a really funny sitcom that makes the most of its talents. I have only seen relatively few episodes, but I like what I've seen. A divorced father is raising his son with help from the father's brother Charlie (who reminds me of Dan from Night Court), and the escapades stem from their adventures. I like the situations the writers come up with for the characters, and I think the scenes with the father's ex-wife are hilarious. I like the cast and writing. All in all, I hope the show sticks around a few more years. I think it can only get better in time.

*** out of ****"
On an upward curve finally,"Dec 14, 2012",9,2,2,"Truth be told, the ninth season had sunk to new lows in some of the episodes and the series appeared to be going nowhere. The writers seemed to be totally out of their depths as to what to do with Walden Schmidt and all that was left of Alan was a loathsome parasite which wasn't funny to watch at all. John Cryer and Ashton Kutcher did well with whatever little they had to hold on to.

But thankfully, this season has sprung a pleasant surprise. There has been ink spent on sensible plots with sprinkles of comical moments. I had never imagined this show without Charlie and the last season seemed to deem my fears correct but now I must admit that I am once again enjoying one of my favorite shows. Although I would like to see a bit more of Jake.

Just hope that the upward swing continues and the series ends on a high whenever it does. Two and a Half men shouldn't leave a bad taste in the mouth at the end like many other shows. It deserves a better farewell than that. And yeah Charlie, you are irreplaceable. Cheers !"
"Would have been a classic, but Kutcher happened","Jan 26, 2021",10,2,2,"Sheen - 9,5/10 Kutcher - 0/10

I am furious that they had to take a bullet to the nutsack and hire Kutcher and not just cancel the show so it would have been a classic."
Usually this wouldn't be my type of sitcom but for some reason I love it,"Jan 4, 2011",9,2,2,"I approached this sitcom with a great deal of cynicism, expecting what you get from most modern sitcoms -sloppy acting, weak dialogue, poorly-written scripts and a terrible overall product. To my surprise this show has defied the genre and actually makes for light-hearted, entertaining and enjoyable viewing One thing that's unique about this show is that the plot, script and the dialogue does not seem to be particularly focused or concentrated -as other posters here have commented, the producers of this show seem to have allowed all three of these concepts to be somewhat vague and free flowing. Usually I dislike this style of executing a concept and it has dire consequences for the show but, in this show, it seems to work well and is perhaps its greatest strength.

The fact that it does is probably a tribute to the professionalism of the cast. Charlie Sheen is perfectly scripted for the role of Charlie Harper -the character seems to come naturally to him and it's almost like the producers wrote the character especially for him. Jon Cryer plays the uptight Alan to great effect and does a great job. Conchatta Farrell (sp?) is wonderful as the housekeeper Berta -she really brings depth to such a comedic role. The actor who plays Jake is great too -he doesn't take the role too seriously and seems to be having fun playing him and that's probably why it works so effectively. Holland Taylor is priceless as Evelyn, Charlie and Alan's mother.. And Marin Hinkle rounds it all off with a wonderful performance as Alan's ex-wife Yes, a lot of the humor is decidedly lowbrow and sometimes it can be over the top but it actually works well within the context of the show and doesn't detract from its quality. The sitcom has the rare trait of being engaging and yet lighthearted and easygoing at the same time, something very hard to accomplish A fun and entertaining show and way better than what I've come to expect from this genre these days"
"sex, debauchery, & filth USED to be funny","May 25, 2014",1,5,3,"Sex, debauchery, & filth USED to be funny, NOW, it;s just sex, debauchery, & filth for the sake of being sex, debauchery, & filth. The pre-Kutcher era had the sex, debauchery, & filth in context, as the ultimate result of Charlie Harper's philandering.

NOW, the focus is the sex, debauchery, & filth and the theme of the show, which isn't at all funny. Throw in the lost lesbian daughter of Charlie Harper and there is just more sex, debauchery, & filth.

Angus Jones, AKA Jake, was ABSOLUTELY correct in his criticisms of the show and was quite smart to leave! It has just become ""filth"" for the sake of being filthy. Sophomoric at best, just vulgar in reality! A GREAT show down the tubes, thankfully this is the last season.

This isn't Kutcher's fault, I'm sure. He started out strong, but the ratings started sliding and the produces decided the gutter was the place to go!"
"It's not that bad, folks!","Feb 25, 2012",10,2,2,"Two and a Half Men was always one of my favorite shows. I loved it from the very beginning and I must say, I was very skeptical when I heard about Charlies death and Ashton Kutcher coming to the show. I mean, Charlie Harper was the show. First, I didn't want to watch it at all, but I decided to give it a chance. And you know what? I liked it. Of course it doesn't feel like Two and a Half Men anymore, but it's like watching a new show, a new GOOD show. I really like Waldens character, and Ashton did a good job. I know you all love Charlie, I love him too, but maybe, just MAYBE it was time to change something in the show. Just because the old seasons are awesome, it doesn't mean that this new isn't. Anyways, that's my opinion. You should give Ashton a chance, and watch a new season."
Jon Cryer single handedly,"Oct 17, 2021",3,3,1,"Sadly, Jon Cryer went way overboard on the sleaziness of his character and brought the humor of the show to the gutter. Taylor Holland is riotous. All in all, not worth the time."
Cliché mania.,"Apr 12, 2005",N/A,7,11,"Don't ask the reason why I watched a few episodes of this cliché filled, highly overrated Hollywood junk. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the tired; rundown boring plot, and silly characters. I've recently read that this show follows Everybody Loves Raymond - go figure. It's a show with a domineering mother followed with a show with another domineering mother. Only difference between the mothers is their apparent sense of fashion.

Let's take a look at a few other clichés. If for some unfortunate reason (unfortunate for the producers) the chubby Jake, played by Angus T. Jones, suddenly fell ill and was therefore unable to continue on the set, it would be an exact replica of ""The Odd Couple"" without the humour. Charlie Harper, played by Charlie Sheen, and Alan Harper, played by Jon Cryer, are so completely different that people claim their mother, played by Holland Taylor, slept with Martin Sheen and then played doctors and nursers with Woody Allen. Another banality is the wise cracking house keeper, who is the funniest character on the show (says a lot about the show) and is exactly like the wise cracking house keeper on ""Will And Grace"". Again, the resemblance is uncanny. Let's not forget the pulchritudinous Rose (Melanie Lynskey), who is also a psychological unstable, clumsy freak who lives next door. She is much like ""Kramer"" from ""Seinfeld"", except Rose is a walking fraction teacher  chubby Jake learnt the fundamentals of fractions by constantly studying the amount of clothing Rose unravels on each episode.

The jokes on the set are as original as ""The Magnificent Seven"". Take for example the jokes about ex-wife lesbian jokes, which was an over used joke on the first season of ""Friends"". It was the last year jokes about lesbian ex wives were funny anymore. Also, the constant jokes about women are definitely the main reason 82 percent of the viewers of the show are male. I think many females would be furious with the shows take on ladies. It's either that or females are far more intellectually superior then men. The second is highly doubtful, but the first comment seems a fair argument. If your wondering I was being sarcastic about my input of the intelligence of both males and females. I just thought it was fitting since the shows jokes are as funny as mine, and draw a lot of negative reviews by female critics.

So, let's go over the cliché cast of the century. Firstly, there is the weird neighbour, the rich playboy bachelor, the lady like dad, the mature ten year old child, the wise cracking house keeper, the lesbian ex-wife, last but not least and domineering mother."
"A high-class,raunchy sitcom","Oct 12, 2006",9,2,2,"Two and a half men is mainly based on adult,raunchy humor,so it's not entirely family-oriented which is definitely on the plus-account,I find it an absolutely fabulous sitcom(even if Seinfeld always will rule).I have three sitcoms I find worth watching(not exactly having the time to follow more anyway),and that's Seinfeld,Frasier and Two and a half men.

Charlie Sheen plays the playboy-type composer(of jingles and commercial ad-tunes mostly)Charlie Harper who lives a carefree,single life in his beach house in Malibu,looked after by his housekeeper Bertha(a wonderful sharp-tongued character and my favorite)and stalked by his neighbor,the kind-hearted Rose with whom he once had a brief affair.Basically he breaks up with at least one girlfriend every week. One day his bachelor life changes drastically as his newly separated,fairly timid and strict brother Al(in many ways Charlie's opposite)moves in after being chucked out by his now ex-wife,the neurotic Judith(from time to time ambivalent regarding her sexuality)who claims Al is suffocating her spiritually.Al has a son(about 10 yrs old),Jake,who lives with him every now and then on a scheduled basis.Charlie,at first very reluctantly,becomes the cool uncle/""second dad"",an opposite to the often uptight father Al.

Jake will not let himself be fooled by embarrassed,lying adults,he asks legitimate questions that makes the adults blush and lie,but he's often just fine with it.He knows,like most kids,more than his parents give him credit for.A great many moments that most adults can relate to are guaranteed...and we must not forget Al and Charlie's narcissistic and self-absorbed mother,who has her own real-estate business and is often,for various understandable reasons,avoided by her sons.Bertha adds many needle-pricks and sharp comments.

The characters are of course somewhat exaggerated,but still very believable(like in Seinfeld),I commend the creators for that achievement.Not too many writers succeed in that.You feel sympathy for them all,even the narcissists.The humor is creative,witty and sharp,and it's refreshing to see that the writers for instance dare to let Al's and Charlie's mother Evelyn be a very selfish,egocentric character and that they dare to portray the son-mother relationship as far from perfect and ideal. They have all more or less neurotic,lazy,uptight,high-strung,immature or narcissistic traits and that makes me love them all even more."
A better pick to replace Charlie,"Nov 19, 2012",8,2,2,"I've been watching this for several years and thought the writing was just wonderfully grossly funny. YES, ESSENTIALLY CHARLIE WAS PLAYING CHARLIE, BUT WHAT A CHARACTER. Also, I should have written this a year or so ago! As his replacement, Ashton Kutcher is fine although the character doesn't quite mesh. To me a better person in keeping with Charlie's personality (and the writers wouldn't have missed a stride) would have been a cousin (or something)played by David Spade. His type of character is a perv just like Charlie and carried on just fine in a like vein. See ""Rules of Engagement"". Of course, he may not have been able to get out of that contract, which would make my suggestion moot!"
"This is surely a laughter overdose,","Feb 19, 2011",10,2,2,"LMAO, LOL, ROFL will all come meaningful after watching this show. This show can change your mood from ""pissed off"" to ""cheerful"" in no time even if you are sick or something. It is created just for laughter and it will make you laugh anyhow, no matter how much the actors have to humiliate others (like Charlie, Jake, Berta, Judith, Evelyn) or get humiliated by others (especially Alan). I'm sure after watching this show your sense of humor will improve and you will spread smiles on other's face in your life. The way each and every actor interacts is unbelievable, all actors can create laughter out of thin air. This show teaches us only one thing and one thing at all which is to enjoy the life in its every shade. After watching few episodes of it you will laugh by just seeing the faces of the actors which is the best part of the show. I can bet that you will laugh in every minute of it. This show is undoubtedly the best comedy show ever made."
Don't understand,"Aug 30, 2012",1,4,2,"Don't understand how it's possible to say that Ashton is an actor! Don't understand how someone can say that THM improved with him! Don't understand why the 10th season! Don't understand and don't believe that anyone see this after the 4th episode of the 9th season without being relatives of the actors. Don't understand how the other actors also worsened with the series! Don't understand how Lore continues making money with the show!Don't understand how they ruined the possibility of returning to succeed, by killing the star of the show! Don't understand many things ...

JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!"
Charlie Sheen,"Feb 26, 2011",10,2,2,"I love the show and would hate to see the rest of the season end. I am not interested in Charlie Sheen's personal life. All I know is that he is good and funny on the show as well as his co-workers who have said he always shows up for work and works just fine. there have been no comments that he has taken his problems to the show. it's all in his personal life that has been brought up. That's life, let him be. Who cares what he does off the set. he shows up and the rest of the cast are funny as well. Please don't cancel the rest of the season..... If he shows signs of not being able to hold his own on the set then that is a different story but so far he is good and again, I love the show."
From hero to zero,"Feb 8, 2020",1,4,2,"This was my favorite show ever till ashton kutcher took over. Yes I can imagine Charlie was a pain in the neck but the producers should have suck it up or just canceled the show. Sheen 10, Kutcher 1."
Funniest Show on TV!!!,"Nov 10, 2008",10,3,6,"I missed the first few seasons but am catching up on re-runs. It's amazing to watch Jake grow up!! The highlight of the show has gotta be Berta....everything out of her mouth is a zinger, but the whole cast is flat out GREAT. I've never seen such a collection of insensitive, self centered, worthless bastards. The situations are like a glimpse of everything that can possibly go wrong in your life presented in a serial format. It's not exactly done with taste either....which I love!!! The episode where Teddy dies has more euphemisms for oral sex than I've heard of and am surprised the censors let go. Of course it's one of the reasons I watch South Park. Amazing guest stars, too. Sean Penn, Elvis Costello, Harry Dean Stanton, and one that had me going through brain damage until I got it: Mannix!!!...Mike Connors. WOW, and what a show of ""who cares?"" when he croaked. All in all, a can't miss show!!!"
I figured out why the series was cancelled,"Jan 27, 2024",9,2,3,"I saw up to Season 10 before I took a job in another country, and I never saw the final seasons until now. The show was very funny until around the middle of Season 7, but after that, the storylines of Charlie's drunken debauchery started to get really old, and it was obvious that the writers were loading Alan up to carry the show as Charlie Sheen's personal life bled over into his business life.

When they moved Charlies out and brought Walden in, the show had a fresh revamp that should have lasted another 8 seasons because it was really funny and there was better chemistry in the show than existed before. Bringing in Ashton as Walden was a genius move (he should have kept the beard, though).

Then, as I wrote above, I took a a job in another country and I missed the last two seasons, and I wondered why it ended so soon. Then I bought the entire series and binge watched it. When I saw Season 12, I understood why it ended.

The whole fake gay marriage thing got really old after only about two episodes, and bringing on a new kid to replace Jake was obviously a dead end from the beginning. Nothing against the kid, but there's no acting talent there, and even the writers clearly realized that because he completely disappeared in the final episodes.

The unending gay jokes were absolutely hilarious for about two episodes, but then got old very fast after that.

That plot line killed the show. I guarantee it. Too bad. It was a very good show."
One of the best shows airing today...,"Feb 1, 2011",8,2,3,"Two and a Half Men... oh man it's been on air since almost 8 years. 8 seasons past and it's still as amazing as it was. I don't know how a person comes up with such an idea and keeps on going strong for such a long period of time. I actually picked up on the show when the 7th Season started and I got all the previous seasons and started watching from the beginning. I was almost sure that by the time I reach the 7th season, the show would be boring. I mean look at How I Met Your Mother... another popular sitcom which has crapped out.

This show is nothing less than legendary. The main character of Charlie Harper and the equally important yet almost completely different character of Alan Harper combine to create an environment full of laughter and clever satire. It effectively portrays modern society. Charlie Sheen is brilliant as Charlie Harper. Jake played Angus is great too though he has gotten a bit stale since of late.

The dialogs have been the bane of this series since it's inception. The way Charlie adds humor to every situation is hilarious. The moment Alan speaks something emotional, it's guaranteed that Charlie has something of his own to counter it. The script has been and is brilliant.

Overall, this show is great. 8 seasons and still going strong. It's sad that now the episodes don't air regularly as they used to before."
a laugh each ten minutes in show that makes no sense,"Feb 4, 2008",2,12,14,"This is sort of a formula sit com. Family situation. I would like to comment on the comedy, but I haven't seen much comedy on this. There is about a laugh every ten minutes, and it's more of a polite laugh than something spontaneous. The characters are hard to comment on, because none of this makes any sense. One brother gets all the women, and one doesn't. It looks like actor Charlie Sheen is so self conscious and insecure that he wants his character to be more than just a super stud. It is totally unreal to such a degree that it can't even be interesting. It would be nice if just being a good looking guy could make all gorgeous women try to go to bed with you. I'm guessing that mostly ugly (or maybe just appearance challenged) guys watch this and think this is the case. I have seen such guys. They really think us hunks can do anything we want. It may be funny to them. It just doesn't make any sense to us hunks. Sorry. There's nothing really mean about this show. It just doesn't make sense. And it just isn't funny."
"Good, Great, then awful.","Apr 2, 2021",8,2,3,"Charlie Sheen era went from strength to strength and was a solid show.

Fine I get they fired him when he went mental after catching aids, but the writers just gave up on the characters.

Kutcher couldn't replace Sheen, and Alan just became a 2 dimensional character, and they made Jake an actual moron.

Show should have finished with Sheen.

If you're just about to start this show, trust me, watch it up until the last Sheen episode. Don't watch anything after that."
Chuck Lorre doesn't know how to write anything without mentioning Asian hooker,"Sep 25, 2021",1,6,5,"Chuck Lorre doesn't know how to write anything without mentioning Asian hookers.

So you probably have an idea of how he spends his private time."
Don't watch from season 9!!!,"Apr 21, 2023",N/A,2,2,"The funniest tv series I have watched, turned into a horror on season 9, where the producers decided to kill Charlie Harper, replacing him (kind of) with terrible Ashton Kutcher. If you had a family loss, or at best, broke with the love of your life, or went through a divorce, you will probably feel something similar. There are great movies with bad ending, but this.... I don't know what Charlie Sheen said or done to the director(or whoever) of the show, probably some bad things, but to disgrace even a memory of Charlie Harper is disgusting. After that, you expect that Charlie will pop up alive and well, and when you google it and find that this is really the end, you are in disbelief.... Not only that I couldn't watch another episode of the show, because it becomes awefull and full of references of dead Charlie, but it spoiled even the episode I have watched before.

I would rather watch a horror movie than the episode where Charlie is found to be dead."
One of the best show ever,"Feb 12, 2022",10,2,3,"Oh boy, what comedy show. First Is saw some fragments here and there and didn't like it, seemed to me like a shabby story, where the only ones laughing were the ...laughs from the soundtrack. But, one day I saw a full episode and I liked it. I saw another one and so on, then I decided to see the whole series. Having Netflix it was easy and I didn't regret it. The screenplay is terrific and Charley Sheen is at his best. The other guy that plays Alan , his brother , he is very good, he acts like a real comedy pro. If you didn't see it or have doubts as I did, just take my word for it and go see it from the beginning, you won't regret it, you will thank me for telling you that."
my TV highlight of the week,"May 14, 2007",10,2,3,"Hubby and I saw 3 episodes of this show while on a very long international flight. We were laughing hysterically at 3 am, trying to not wake up the rest of the flight. Upon returning home, this is our must see show of the week. All work stops while we have our belly laughs. The writing is absolutely supreme. The not so subtle lines keep coming, one right after another. The actors' timing is perfect. Thw wisecracking housekeeper fits in great, as an outsider who throws in the perfect observations. This is a sitcom for adults who have a brain............oh so rare. Every actor is suited to his and her roles, perfectly. I don't like kids, but they use the kid JUST enough to keep it funny."
Great with Sheen...Awful with Kutcher,"Nov 5, 2020",8,2,3,"This was a very entertaining, enjoyable and great show with Charlie Sheen. When Ashton Kutcher showed up it went downhill like a bullet. The change to the Alan character was disturbing, disappointing and downright horrible. I watch all the reruns that have Sheen and immediately flip the channel when its Kutcher"
The mighty have fallen,"Aug 13, 2010",5,9,10,"For the first four years of it's run Two and a Half men was one of the strongest sitcoms ever. It had strong acting, strong stories and at the centre of the sitcom it had a lot of heart.

Sadly after the initial four years the series changed, the writing started to lose it's spark and the performances became forced and cartoonish. The standard was still high but it felt like something was missing. The CSI crossover episode for me was where I felt that the series had gone too far.

The show had always been slightly risqué in its humour but this has become more and more explicit to the point where it is uncomfortable to watch. It always presenting women in a bad light and I cannot think of one likable woman in the piece.

Overall this series looks like it will be milked until everyone gets sick of it but I think the show peaked around series four and will never hit those heights again."
I love this show,"Jan 6, 2004",10,3,8,"I've always liked Charlie Sheen, he has a flair for comedy that is incredible. John Cryer is the perfect spaz. Thumbs up to whoever did the casting of this show. Too often great movie or tv scripts are wasted on bad casting. Here's hoping this show will run for a long time."
new two and a half men with Kutcher sucks baaaaad,"Nov 12, 2011",1,8,9,"i have checked the ""contains spoiler"" box cos i am not sure if what i am saying contains spoilers or not but at least i know it contains some sort of summary. so in order not to be black listed by IMDb i have checked it just to be on the safe side

Before i get into it let me point out that i have nothing against Kutcher, he is OK in my book its the the producers i blame.

Firstly, what they should have done was try and get Charlie back, but if they felt that was out of the question then the next option was to get a Charlie look alike and then have him continue as the character of Charlie harper. After all i have seen countless number of times where actors have been replaced by complete different faces without anyone complaining. a good example is ""my wife and kids"" with Damon Wayans where his daughter in the sitcom was replaced and when the episode with the new girl started, Damon made a funny remark by telling the daughter that she looked different from the previous day.

Thirdly, if they didn't wanna stick to either of the first two points then they have just canceled the damn show. We would have been left with good memories of the sitcom instead of this garbage which is already smearing the funny memories i had of 2.5 men.

Having Ashton come in and acting as an immature person more than Jake is so annoying.....no grown up watching this sitcom would relate to a grown up behaving like a kid. it simply isn't normal. But with Charlie's character one could relate with him or rather it was fun to watch them always out doing each other and in the long run you could see that they loved each other.

What really put me off with the new season 9 was the ridiculous funeral that was held for Charlie at the beginning of the episode. First of all how come none of his family wept a single tear? also who makes insulting remarks when a funeral is going on? Also it wasn't even funny. Basically this new 2.5 men isn't funny at all but rather boring. I already dislike the old characters (Alan, Jake, Bertha, Evelyn, etc) based on the direction where this is going. i recommend u watch it just to see for yourself. But if u have better sitcoms like Community, then rather watch that and save yourself from agony or time wastage. so in summary 2.5 men gets 0/10 stars."
3 seasons on air and better than ever!,"Sep 29, 2005",N/A,2,2,"This is one of the funniest shows on TV today, with a stellar cast. Written by Chuck Lorre, who wrote ""Dharma and Greg,"" and episodes of ""Roseanne"" and ""Cybil,"" the episodes are tightly-woven and cleverly written, with sharp-witted observations by Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Angus T. Jones, Holland Taylor, and Conchata Ferrell; they are all first-rate. The show has won several awards in the three seasons it's been on, including an Emmy or two.

In the series, Charlie Harper (Sheen), an ad jingle writer and a consummate bachelor/ womanizer lives alone in his beach house in Malibu, until his brother Alan (Cryer), an uptight ""sensitive guy"" chiropractor, is divorced by his bitchy wife. He comes to live with Charlie, and his smart-mouthed son (Jones) joins them on weekends (and it always seems to be a weekend at Charlie's house). The cast is well-seasoned by their mother (Holland Taylor) and their ferocious housekeeper (Conchata Ferrell), as well as neurotic neighbor and former bed partner Rose.

The theme song is the most memorable, catchy tune on TV today, both versions; it was written by Chuck Lorre. As in ""Dharma and Greg,"" he runs vanity cards at the end of each episode."
A Great show but some obvious mistakes,"Sep 24, 2009",10,2,4,"Well the show is going great, I mean the characters r going good, the plot is still interesting and the dialog makes it one of the best sitcoms.

Charlie is really a wonderful character, there's not enough to act though for CHARLIE.

Alan wow, the character is goofy, slow, retarded but the acting done by Jon Cryer is the best act of the series.

Jake is fine but he is still learning acting.

My favorite are Alan and Evelyn. Both have done great work and the writers off course have done a mind blowing job.

There have been many mistakes during the show. Like in some episodes Charlie while using iPhone did hold it wrong(upside down) while calling. I mean come on man ppl other than u have iPhones, they know where the Mic and the speaker are. Another mistake u ppl might have noticed, At the start of season 7, Charlie is about to Merrie a girl named ""chelsie"", who first appeared in the pilot of the series as an extra at a shopping store and then she appears in season 2, episode 11, as a girl who Charlie goes for confession and her name is ""Tina"" here."
Here's my take on it,"Sep 10, 2008",10,2,4,"Okay, for a while I heard about Two and a Half Men. I just rolled my eyes at it, even though it intrigued me that Martin Sheen guest stared in it and I do like Charlie Sheen a lot. But I didn't think I would like the humor. Boy was I wrong! Here I was, flipping the channels and I came across it. I didn't know any of the characters, any of the plots, but within five minutes it already had me laughing like crazy. I've only seen a handful of episodes here and there but each time I stop to watch it, I end up watching the whole episode. Been a while since a sitcom has done that for me. Remindes me of the good whole days when you had quality comedy like 3rd Rock From the Sun, Fraiser, Friends, Home Improvement, and Whose Line Is It Anyway. Really the only decent sitcom that's airing right now, especially since they had canceled Knights of Prosperity. Try watching it for five minutes without at least chuckling. Go on, I dare you."
best comedy show ever .. !!,"Dec 7, 2007",10,2,4,"the best comedy ever..

I never saw as fun as this..

every episode my eyes tears from laughing..

one of the best episodes, in season 5, when Charlie sings for children in a concert, he didn't had the guts to go on stage, so he goes drunk !!.

after the song ""goodbye boobies"", he said: ""who love boobies ?"", and the children said: ""Charlie .."", in that moment, i couldn't breath , i paused the episode, and i laughed and laughed and laughed ...

believe me, this is the best comedy you can get.."
Boring !,"Nov 17, 2003",1,14,21,"I tried to watch this show...once! It's boring. Sheen & Cryer are not funny, and that kid.....Zzzzzzzzz. At least all three of the leads have one thing in common......they can't act. Sheen was good in ""Platoon"", but that was a long time ago. Cryer was pretty good in ""Dudes"", but that was also a long time ago. And that kid....well he hasn't had a long time ago, and the way he acts...he won't."
Not funny,"Dec 27, 2014",1,4,3,"I tried a few episodes from the Sheen days then a few from the Kutcher days. Unfortunately, none of them made me laugh, even when the boy was there.

The jokes felt a bit forced and the nonstop inappropriate jokes were just too much. That combined with with a laugh track makes it pretty unbearable.

I'm surprised that the show is as popular as it is and that it lasted this long. It's one of those shows where if it hits your sense of humor, you may find it hilarious. If it misses your sense of humor like it did mine, you will probably find it pretty painful."
Pretty good show,"Jan 15, 2004",N/A,4,8,"I've always liked Charlie Sheen, and thought he did a fine job replacing Michael J. Fox on ""Spin City,"" so I was looking forward to seeing him on another sitcom. The two episodes I've seen were pretty funny. Sheen and John Cryer have a good chemistry. They have worked together before on ""Hot Shots."" Cryer is kind of a dull actor and I'm not a big fan of him, but he just serves as the straight man. Sheen provides most of the laughs, and he's great at delivering one-liners with pitch-perfect timing. So far, CBS has been coming out with the best shows. This is another fine addition to the Monday night lineup.

My score: 7 (out of 10)"
Go Charlie,"Feb 24, 2015",10,1,1,"In my opinion, Charlie Sheen was one of the best reasons that made this show an Amazing hilarious show ( Two and a Half Men is my favorite show and will always love to watch it) but You can't just try to destroy his image in the last episode, and try to turn his character into a monster or whatever that was!!! Sorry but disappointed! That wasn't cool to attack one of the best reasons for your success! And by the way, even if you say that ""trying"" anger management ""didn't work"" i still love it, and support Charlie Sheen. It is hurtful to hear ""didn't work"" from Alan! Wow that was too much man!! No disrespect, but it is disappointing to see this fight after all the brilliant job that you've done together :("
The last esse the best,"Mar 18, 2021",10,1,1,Keeping the proportions of Charlie Sheen and his madness having ended the series. the last episode was the best in history. congratulations chuck lorre
"I'm talking about ""Two and a half men"" not the desperate remakes","Jun 4, 2016",10,1,1,"Two and a half men (from season 1 to season 8) is the best sitcom i've ever seen in my whole life، the big differences between the characters is what made this show extremely hilarious! the jokes are crazy the cast are PERFECT there is not much of romance، drama or lousiness but only pure comedy which happens to be this show's category! i've seen other works for Chuck Lorre like ""The big bang theory"" and even him probably know that this show is no good and has nothing to do with comedy. The guy have messed up one of the greatest sitcoms in the world، so thank you Chuck! since charlie sheen left the show it became ""Three boring men"" with so much in common between the characters the show bored me to death. and after Jake was gone they realized the importance of having a new charlie in the show so they brought a girl who's supposed to be charlie's daughter! but is it Two and a half men again? no it's not! so at the last season they decided to bring a child to the crew that replaces Jake but it didn't work out either! but still every time i think of giving it a rate lower than 10 i remember the first 8 seasons and realize it's a huge mistake not to give it a 10/10 rating. RIP Two and a half men."
The New Charlie,"May 16, 2011",1,4,3,"Do not let anyone, exspecially Ashton Kutcher take over or come in as a replacement for Charlie Sheen. If Charlie will not be able to come back, then cancel the show! It will not last without him, and Ashton is not Charlie! I mean you guys wrote this for Charlie, what did you expect when he lived up to his reputation, not only in the show but in real life! Geeeee, lets give him money(lots of money) to play basically himself, and see where that leads! It led to one of the best shows on TV, and a train wreck for him! Instead of replacing him, help him and get the show back to what it was or just quit while your ahead! And thats all I have for you right now.By the way i am yelling this!"
This review is for Charlie sheen,"Aug 10, 2021",10,1,1,1st 7 seasons were ridiculously amazing Laugh riot . Never have I ever laughed so much watching a TV series.
Misogyny throughout!,"Jun 12, 2021",1,8,10,"It is sad so many people love this misogynistic series. It destroys the minds of the sad souls that find it funny. The way women are portrayed in this series, no wonder not many men can talk to women, have terrible misconceptions and can even be dangerous in our society.

Some young men watching this would want to be that cassanova, but then go into society and behaving foolishly, reducing their chances of being kind or gentle, or even themselves.

No wonder you cannot relate to women in your life.

Want to laugh whilst having better female and male role models? Try friends!"
almost boring,"Sep 29, 2014",N/A,3,5,"the good intentions are the basis of series. the desire to explore each possibility of hilarious scene, the mixture between vulgarity and same stereotypes, the desire to resurrect a death script because each event was exhausted and the lost of Charlie Sheen not was the most inspired option. but the real problem is Angus T. Jones. his grow-up transforms the series in a too long collection of fake situations. Ashton Kuncher is far to be the best answer to crisis. so, a series who, season by season, becomes almost boring. the ideas are too fragile, the humor - too low. and the charm from beginning - lost at whole. a series. like many others. who has the ambition to survive more than the desire to represent a good job."
THE best sitcom,"Jul 14, 2020",10,1,1,"I love this show, everything about it is incredibly enjoyable. Seasons 1 - 8 are the classics where Charlie Sheen was still in the show, his lifestyle and attitude towards his Brother Alan and his Nephew Jake is hilarious, the way that Charlie and Alan banter off each other makes you wish that they were actually brothers in real life. Personally after Charlie left and Actor Ashton Kutcher steppes in I found the episodes to be just as enjoyable. You can't watch it thinking it's gonna be the same as when Charlie Sheen was in it, it takes a completely different approach but they still make it work. For me personally Two And A Half men will always remain a 10/10 with and without Charlie Sheen."
It was better with Charlie Sheen,"Oct 6, 2021",8,1,1,"I really thought that Charlie had died for real! The TV show went down hill after he left, or died, or whatever."
"Maybe the best comedy show, ever.","Aug 27, 2021",9,1,1,"I think, if had to choose the best comedy series ever, at least judging form early years, it is this show.

I have the chance to see them from the very first season and it is what i needed. Small in length, full of smart lines. This and Kominsky method are my favorites. I laugh and this is their goal....."
Season 9 isn't funny,"Oct 18, 2011",3,5,5,"I've purchased the first five episodes from iTunes, but it's just not funny. At all. Five chances, no laughs. The biggest problem is the writing. Without the laugh track, it would be hard to know what's supposed to be funny. The second biggest problem is the choice of new actors. I have no idea if Ashton Kutcher can be funny, but he's got nothing to work with here. I sure understand why Charlie Sheen was replaced... but he WAS funny. Courtney Thorne-Smith completely loses me as Jon Cryer's girlfriend, she is so bland, I want to fast forward through her scenes. Those two have nothing in common and she could (and would in real life) do better. Conchata Ferrell and Jon Cryer need better lines, The boy who plays Jake grew up and just isn't the funny little kid he was, and unfortunately didn't grow into a funny teen. I feel like the show tried to buy known actors to get out of the slump and it hasn't worked. There are a lot of problems, which makes me doubtful this show can be fixed. I have ideas, however. Call me CBS."
Let's talk about the time it actually was great.,"Apr 13, 2015",9,1,1,"There are many reviews where someone is just talking about how the later seasons just plain suck. And there's no questioning it. They DO suck. But I can somewhat ignore those seasons when I watch an earlier episode and am reminded of how hilarious the show used to be.

At first, it was nothing special for me. Just a show I'd casually watch or have in the background. But one day I decided to buy the complete first season on DVD. You wonder why? Well, I did get furious at the stupid Walden character already back when he was introduced, but I wasn't quite sure of HOW much I liked the seasons before that. So it was pretty much a total dare to buy the box set. I actually had no flippin' clue if I would become a real fan or not.

I watched the first episode. I found it awesome. I watched a couple more. They were awesome too. Halfway into the season, I had already become a fan. Now when I had started watching it chronologically, I payed more attention to all the various characters, jokes and plots. That way, I found the show a whole lot more entertaining than I did before. And when I got to the third season, I DIED laughing. I had arrived to the best season of the entire show. The jokes were sharper than ever and the Harper brothers were at their very best. I f'ucking love season 3. Season 5 was a stepdown from 1-4, as the plots were getting lazier and some of the jokes felt quite forced. But you know what? It was still good! Season 5 has some definitive classic episodes. And now I'm at the end of season 6 and I still think the episodes are mostly great. In fact, if an episode has Charlie in it, you are rarely ever bored.

The only reason it's a 9 and not a 10 is because even the early episodes have some flaws, like the really really dumb fart jokes. But the good sure outweighs the bad.

If you want a testament of how outrageously funny the show used to be, watch the first 7 seasons. 8 is not as good as it has bigger flaws, but eh it's all right. At least it has Charlie.

Cheers."
This was a bad show with Sheen and is just as unfunny with Kutcher,"May 8, 2012",1,6,7,"I had never seen this show until Kutcher joined, so I made a point of looking at over dozen episodes during the Sheen period, from various seasons, to see what all the fuss was about.

This is a show populated by idiots and annoying people. Cryer's character is an awful person with no redeeming qualities. Sheen's character while slightly more nuanced is still pathetically boring and unfunny. With arrival of Kutcher, the tone has certainly changed but it's still crap.

How a show like this remains on the air for 9 seasons and excellent material like Arrested Development is canceled is simply a testament to the limited IQ of most TV viewers.

People will probably say that since I haven't followed the show from the start that I can't truly appreciate it, that's just an excuse to dismiss this review.

I had never seen The Big Bang Theory until this season and was immediately impressed with the writing and characters. TAAHM has none of that. It's crap in season 1 and it's crap now."
Can be entertaining but not for me.,"Nov 11, 2020",N/A,2,3,Every single episode is boring and every plot twist is obvious which makes this show bad in my opinion. It can be entertaining in case you want to spend some time but not if you are looking for a good show to watch.
10 with Charlie 2 with ashton,"Jul 17, 2019",10,1,1,"Chuck Lorre this comedy. He must have really hated ,Charlie. With the addition of his other slight comedy which for some reason made fortune and spawned another dud but seemingly popular he decided to kill Charlie off. Hell he's worth $800 million. So he can spew his hatred of President Trump and religion all he wants with his shows and vanity card. Seems very unhappy. Too bad. ""Hi, Mr Horned One ""was the Best One Ever."
So good I could watch it over and over,"Dec 1, 2021",10,1,1,"It's one of the best TV shows ever. My favorite is Friends, but Two and a Half men found a place in my heart, too. I definitely will watch it again. The way Charlie, Alan, and Berta played their roles is amazing."
One of a very few funny American comedies.,"Sep 30, 2018",9,1,1,"After watching all the seasons of this show, I've come to the conclusion that Jon Cryer's character, Alan, is more morally compromised than Charlie ever was. Charlie is always consistent with his values. He doesn't pretend to be a goody-goody. Alan is a virtuecrat who violates his own espoused moral values, often. The worse case of this is in season 8 when Alan starts a relationship with Lyndsey while having an affair with his office assistant, Melissa.

Alan abandons his values when his own personal gain is a possibility. In the end, even though I loved the show, I grew to detest Alan. It became visceral."
Just not funny/involving anymore,"Feb 21, 2012",1,3,2,"This is my first ever review. I have no preference between Charlie or Ashton. All I can say is that the show is focused way too much on Ashton and his sexual escapades and there is hardly any involvement of the ancillary characters anymore. I love Conchata Ferrell and have ever since Hot L Baltimore (I'm 52 BTW). The lack of interplay between the characters has just left an empty hull of a show that used to be really funny. Back when Alan and his mother and Judith and Herb used to have a real presence on the show it was funny. Without them being an integral part of the show it all falls flat for me. I have watched the show ever since it premiered and even watch the syndicated episodes when they are on, but I don't expect any of the recent episodes will ever be on my watch list. Sorry, but you might as well send in the clowns..."
"Great Show, Great Charly","Jan 3, 2023",10,1,1,"I binged watched the entire show over the end of 2022 holidays. I loved it. The show pivots around Charly who basically portrays himself. Kudos to Jon Cryer, Conchata, Angus, Holland Taylor (my favorite), Melanie Lynski and the rest. The characters were perfect, the actors clicked along, nobody played out of tune and the writers kept feeding them good lines, but after 8 years the good material was drying up and the show was becoming more vulgar so Charly left/was fired at the right time.

I live in Indiana and it is striking how all the cultural issues addressed in the show are striking here only now. California is ten to twenty years ahead of us."
Cryor takes the cake for me in this show,"Jan 18, 2011",5,3,2,"I'm finally watching and enjoying this show after it ran its course, and the way they strip it now (M-F) is to have an early episode first and then a later one right after. I can see how much fresher and funnier the first eps were compared to the later ones. Among the early comments here someone wondered how long it could run with the same premise. Well. Starting out, it was delightfully witty and cool--I am usually bent over with laughter watching it. Years later, it's jokes just got cruder (everything was a sexual pun) and meaner-- especially directed at Alan who essentially became just a whipping boy. It's really obvious in the way they put the older and newer episodes back to back like that. Jake isn't so funny as a teenager.

The characters were a little two-dimensional to begin with but its sad to see it become so one-dimensional. I simply cannot stand Charlie in the later episodes. (I have the greatest respect for Charlie Sheen and his father-- Wall Street is one of the best films!) He may have had the best one-liners, but so many of them were directed in sadistic mockery at his brother (his bed-wetting, his naivete, his incompetence with women) that it just became unpleasant. It takes an actor's actor to play the straight man to the comic. Cryor was brilliant in this, in his reactions, his obsessions, his idealism, his fussiness, his neurotic sense of responsibility... but while Charlie and Jake and the mother sank into cussed meanness at his expense, his character collapsed into ludicrously stupid (something like this to his ex-wife: ""nothing's changed really, I guess we could start over again... only this time I wouldn't be a virgin"" <--paraphrase). Sheesh! It's as though they finally succeeded in pounding him into the eunuch they believed him to be, or the writer's just catered to a dumber audience. This show just couldn't replicate the same kind of chemistry between two opposite men that you saw in The Odd Couple or even Andy of Mayberry.

One of the most poignant scenes in the show--illustrating that it COULD rise to poignancy--is when Alan confessed tearfully to an attractive woman who kissed him that he ""hadn't been touched for so long."" To a laugh track. There you go.

Raise your glass to Jon Cryor for staying the course. It's easy to be Charlie. It's harder to be Alan. Finally, it's just easy to say the lines because they're so undemanding.

Loving the earlier eps..."
Can't stand the kid!,"Dec 16, 2005",N/A,4,12,"Jake, the 1/2 man of the show's title is the most annoying sitcom child that I've seen in a long time. He's a fat, lazy, lethargic slob who makes Bart Simpson seem like Harvard material. I have never been a serious fan of the show, but Jake is completely unlikable. It is irritating when Jake tries to be a Charlie clone, as we all know that will never happen. Jake is very disrespectful to his father Alan, and walks all over him. Has anyone noticed a resemblance between Jake and Charlie's maid? She could be his mother, which would be more realistic. Maybe, when the series finale comes, it could be revealed that the maid is really Jake's mother who had a one-night stand with some Hell's Angel and that Alan and his ex-wife adopted him. This kid would have been a better fit as Roseanne's son if that show were on now. He could be the poster child for Planned Parenthood. A picture of him in an ad targeted at teens would help cut down the teen pregnancy rate in America."
Still amazing!!,"Aug 10, 2022",10,1,1,"Look, I get it that people hate on the Ashton episodes. But this show is so great, obviously the Charlie episodes are hilarious. I still watch this show today. Never gets old."
Makes me smile EVERY time!,"Apr 30, 2011",10,2,5,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I LOVE this show!!!!!!!!! Every, and i mean EVERY single time i watch this one (and i can proudly say that i watched all episodes) - it simply puts a big smile on my face. Ch.Sheen is Brilliant in this sitcom. J.Cryer is Amazing. I can say - this is the best (OK OK, just for me) sitcom EVER. Writers of this show are the guys, who gave me most of vitamin C i ever had (that's what she said too). Watch this one, this is funny as hell.

P.S. If Ch. Sheen leaves this one, as good as the other cast is, my favorite sitcom is doomed."
"Awesome with Charlie, awesome with Walden...","Jun 10, 2015",9,2,5,"I love this show. It's so funny. Basically, the show has two sections. Season 1 - 8 is the Charlie Sheen section and Season 9 - 12 is the Ashton Kutcher section. I think all the characters are funny and the cast portrayed them very well. Jake is so hilarious around Season 4, 5 and 6. Not saying he's not funny the other seasons. I am glad that Ashton Kutcher got four seasons, as it would've been a big disappointment if the show had ended a season after he started.

This show is about Alan, a newly-divorced man who moves into his brother, Charlie's Malibu beach house, with his ten-year-old son, Jake. A lot of hilarious stuff happens throughout the years. And after Charlie dies, Alan convinces the new owner, Walden, to let him continue living there, rent-free.

Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome."
Great with Charlie. Bad with Walden.,"Sep 6, 2020",5,3,2,"This show was one of the best comedies on TV when Charlie was there. But everything went in the toilet when he left. Including the writing.

There was a little growth when Charlie was there. Alan was getting a little cooler. And Charlie was starting to grow up, develop appreciation for family, and responsibility --- a little.

But when he left, the writers turned Alan from a moral, ethical stuff shirt --- into an immoral, unethical, hedonistic, penny pinching idiot. He completely digressed into an unappealing and unlikeable character.

The jokes were clever when Charlie was there. They were stupid, slapstick and juvenile after he left.

I don't blame the management for getting rid of Sheen. His public meltdown was epic. But there was no reason to change the basic formula of the show.

This show was never for everybody. But I'd recommend watching the first 8 years with Charlie. And skipping the final 4 with Walden."
Has everything to be a blast of entertainment.,"Jul 26, 2009",10,3,10,"""Two and a Half Men"" went against all expectations and ended being one of the most creative, witty, and creative sitcoms of the new millennium.

I watched and liked the show for it's clever writing and acting, not because of the clichéd premise. But to get things done perfectly, you need a superb script, innovative direction and situations, and most important; great acting by actors with high histrionic abilities and capacity for comedy.

Charlie Sheen doesn't have problems playing well, Charlie Sheen. He's the soul of the show and delivers one of his best performances ever. Enough said. He freaking rules. Jon Cryer demonstrates he is a serious, talented actor who was born for shining in supporting roles. He brings the perfect equilibrium for Charlie's character. Angus T. Jones is fantastic as the rebel kid who throws the most funny punch lines.

The humor is sexual oriented most of the time but it's written in such a funny manner and with creativity that it will never get vulgar.

The supporting characters are extremely funny and always add the spice. Bertha is by far the most funny of them. She's the only one who can make fun of Charlie. Holland Taylor is delicious as the selfish, eccentric, sometimes evil mother. She's excellent! Overall, this show should last for more seasons and I'm sure it won't lose gas. It will keep on getting up."
Another show I can't get into,"Jun 24, 2011",2,14,27,"Okay, when this show first started, I actually quite liked it. I found the writing quite funny and creative and I liked some of the interplay between the characters. But over time, Two and a Half Men has become duller and more stale, I feel similarly about How I Met Your Mother too. The production values are good as is Charlie Sheen, the only actor to have any real life in his character, but that's it. The writing and jokes that were once creative are now stale and forced, even lacking in subtlety, while the story lines introduce good themes but don't introduce and explore them well and the stories themselves feel rushed and predictable. The characters are not very likable now, some actually are annoying and act like idiots. Now they've replaced Sheen, while I am overall not impressed with the show, I think regardless of his problems I think replacing him is a mistake, without him the show really is going to be a dead weight even with all the other faults it has. All in all, a decent show when it started, now it is unwatchable and hard to get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
"The odd couple, with a kid","Oct 3, 2005",N/A,3,8,"I have to say, I lean towards agreeing with 'bad one liners followed by canned laughter'. This style of sitcom certainly had it's day, but after seeing THE OFFICE or ARRESTED Development, it becomes clear why people are tuning into reality shows.

That's not to knock the actors, who try valiantly to beat some humor into the proceedings. Cryer, in particular, has a way with a line that makes it come to life, even on the lifeless episodes. And Sheen does a nice job parodying himself in a way. I even grew to like the little kid, always the most dangerous cast member on a sitcom.

But the show seems to be sinking somehow, losing it's fun, and trying harder at the same time, which I find hard to watch. If they would just be brave and do one without a laugh track, which I personally think is killing the great American sitcom, the writing would HAVE to change, because they'd hear what jokes work rather than try and convince us that a joke is funny by using canned laughter.

Anyway. Not an entirely bad way to kill half an hour, and some talent involved, but not really worth making 'appointment television'."
A review of Two and a Half Men (without Charlie),"Sep 20, 2011",10,3,10,"Two and a Half Men has always been one of my favorite shows on television. I will admit the show is different without Mr. Sheen, but the humor hasn't change. I will go over several things in my review, including the following... the acting, the humor and of course Ashton Kutcher.

The acting has always been solid in the previous shows. Jon Cryer does amazing as always. I was disappointed Angus (Jake) only had two lines. I can feel that the writers are struggling with writing Jake into the story now that he's older, but he delivered the lines perfectly. Berta is also hilarious with the few lines she delivers. Rose also makes a quick cameo that shouldn't disappoint!

The humor of this show is not for everyone. I know for a fact some people may find the first 5-10 minutes of the premiere of the show to be in bad taste. People who loved past episodes of Men should not be disappointed with the humor in this episode. I will admit I laughed out loud several times. Most of the humor in this episode comes from Allen (Cryer). Ashton does deliver some of the humor, but it's Allen's reactions that are priceless.

Now on to what people are most interested in, Ashton Kutcher. Kutchers' acting was barely good in this episode. His acting did improve into the show, but most of the time he seemed awkward, maybe that's his character, I don't know. I can tell that Kutcher grows more into his role as Walden as the show progresses. By the end of the season he should be grown into the character fully.

While the show was good, Ashton could improve a lot. I predict there will be another season after this. The show will get the same ratings it has gotten in the past. Why? Because all of Ashton Kutcher fans are replacing the Charlie Sheen fans that are leaving. Not much has changed in the show, besides Kutcher replacing Sheen. Give this show a go, you won't regret it."
More comedy and fun than before,"Mar 17, 2013",10,3,11,"Well seriously, I don't know what problem do people have with Charlie Sheen being replaced.Yeah I agree the show was excellent when sheen was there but still after the entry of Ashton Kutcher I would say that the show hasn't lost its sheen.And I might want to say to the extent that it has become even more humorous with Alan still being a irritating guy and Walden being the rich guy but at the same time being childlike as well. And the only thing I miss is that now Jake is not cute anymore and it is no fun to watch him anymore. Having said so, the creators are smart enough giving only a minute or two to the character of Jake per episode.

Don't judge the show only because Charlie sheen is absent. Enjoy it for what it is. For me it is still 10 out of 10."
Charlie rules,"Aug 16, 2018",10,1,2,"I gave it a 10 for the earlier seosona Ashton,s seasons i give it 6 maximum"
OK to watch if there's not much else on...,"Feb 12, 2008",1,5,6,"At first, I thought the show was slightly entertaining. The drunken mother and sassy housekeeper made me laugh on more than one occasion. Even Allan's neurotic craziness had me going for awhile.

Last night's episode about Charlie sleeping with Allan's divorce lawyer and hitting on her assistant right in front of her though about made me commit to never watching it again.

Charlie's womanizing ways get tiresome quite quickly. His lack of respect for women is so blatantly obvious and becomes almost offensive after awhile. When there's actually a good plot line that doesn't revolve around Charlie trying to bed as many women as possible in one show, it's fun to watch, but that happens maybe 2% of the time. I'm not a feminist by any means, but I find this show unusually cruel to women and am offended that it completely condones men treating women like disposable trash.

No wonder our world is the way it is. Shows like this are on the air."
Funny,"Mar 22, 2018",10,1,2,I think this is the funniest show out there I would strongly recommend it if you like crash sick humour
"I use to love this show. I was young, I didn't know any better","Nov 27, 2012",3,5,6,"I'm not joking. I used to love this show. It was my favorite show. I looked forward to watching it everyday. Now that I think about it, I don't remember what I liked about the show exactly. But, now I have finally seen the light, and how bad this show is. It's just unfunny, whether Charlie Sheen is the lead or Ashton Kutcher is the lead. It doesn't matter, because the show still sucks. Every single character on here is horrible and unfunny. Every single joke is repetitive and unfunny after the second time. This show gets progressively worse and worse and they're really running out of ideas at this point. At first, I liked the earlier seasons when Jake was younger and actually funny, but he's just bad now. I hate this show. I'm trying to quit watching this show. It's awful. Please don't watch it ever. If you haven't seen it within the last ten years, you are a decent human being. I can see why Angus T. Jones has called this show ""filth"". It's awful, it's horrible, any other word for awful. It's that bad."
10/10 With Charlie Sheen - 5/10 Without,"Oct 16, 2011",N/A,2,4,"A quote from one of the shows fans before Charlie left: ""The today's casting cannot match, and I am speaking just for myself here, the acting level of the former show...The first series were for me, for each and every time I was coming back late from work, like a deep relaxing infusion of pure undiluted small packs of happiness...just hearing Charlie's voice had the effect of instantly soothing the atmosphere even in my most stressed times. That said, some of the episodes, especially on the 7th series were already showing some fatigue,and if I am truly sincere, I was already sensing an altering in Charlie's acting and probably the drug / alcohol's influence that represented, so obviously now, a great part of his life. There was in his first performances a wonderful balance of coolness, smoothness with an evident feeling of a greater potential in the background that the public was able to almost feel throughout the screen. Right from the start he tried to seem relaxed, present, and joyful, but there was something darker, disturbing, stranger and more magnetic in his acting. The direction of the script, quite predictable and boring in it's essence, was involuntarily leading the audience to believe that the show was somehow classic and static, sedentary and safe through and through until Charlie kicked in, every time, practically in every episode, revealing a feisty acting romp proving that though his doing a sitcom, he still has the sass of his best previous days. Charlie proved that he could be full of cheek and charm, falling sometimes in the cheesy part of ordinary but then, with a sudden change of his face, could elevate the show from good to great and rise well above the targeted acting level of such a common production...Charlie showed us his love for acting and this cleavage between doing a sitcom and the unusual and incredible actor that he is made for me the greatness of the show...With sudden bursts of extraordinary, merely unperceived for the inexperienced eye, he was the engine behind the public fascination and finally behind the show's huge success. Charlie is part of an endangered one-of-kind actor breed, ultimately true to his own acting vision. The series having him as a the star are destined to be classic. Unfortunately, today's show, although good and funny, cannot math the complex power and chemistry of it's original ingredients. And, further on, the publicity and advertising that they were trying to make using Charlie Sheen's recent behavior and the media frenzy around it are expressing for me the disillusionment of a generation, the cynicism of today's world, and a deep inquietude and profound questioning for the future's new emerging TV series. Charlie was a very special product of his time, with enormous acting potential (I consider him one of the most emotionally gifted actors Hollywood has ever seen, probably matched only by Robert Downey Jr. and Sean Penn), an interesting combination of his original personality intricate with his complex family acting and education background. His early appearances were already showing a very sensitive and emotionally responsive individual. By the time he had his first major role (in Platoon), and further on (in Wall Street), he magisterially impersonated the man's ability to save himself from himself, with no possible solution to the dilemma other than to try to morally emerge/reborn and vanquish one's degrading status quo; his prodigious performing in that two movies will always remain in my memory as a vivid and deeply caustic criticism towards the society itself, Charlie becoming at the time a(n) (in)voluntary vehicle for many revolutionary ideas in a changing world; under the magic directing of Oliver Stone, he brought up into the light with his characters the deepest of men's amorality, the superficiality of contemporary thought and feeling and surprisingly/paradoxically, hope.

We have to believe that Charlie can and will brake loose from the chains of his actual behavior and will rejoin his path, family and friends. My opinion is that he has made the unfortunate choice of living with people that don't fulfill his real emotional needs; with his new entourage he has gone down on the highways of partying, on a very tortuous and dangerous ride, wasting his human and professional potential. Yes, his new friends will give him some frivolous frugal moments of so called happiness, but in return they will bring back and exponentially enhance the drug related problems and the gradual social isolation. His new acquired friends will act in the faith that the present is more rewarding and meaningful than the unknown tomorrow, embracing some sort of twisted carp diem philosophy, caring only for the easy money and the 15 minutes of fame, as any insignificant ephemeris would do, witnesses and finally collateral victims in Charlie's troubled times. The ones that still love Charlie must carve a tunnel of hope through the dark imprisoning mountain that he built around him. I hope his family and friends as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. If for one reason or another, his close ones do not come to his aid, I must say that I have doubt about the future and fear about the outcome of his struggle. Even if his motives are at present misunderstood or his behavior might seem erratic, his family and friends have to reach the goal of freeing Charlie from this form of auto-abuse. Before going to bed each night his family and friends must think at his suffering, even if it's well hidden and drowned in alcohol and drugs. They have to prevail because they love him, helping him even more when he's proving he does not love himself, and further on, they must protect the heritage of such extraordinary being and actor."""
One and a Half Men without Sheen,"Jul 27, 2018",10,1,2,"My shortest review ever...watch season 1-8, then punt. Honestly, one of the best written and acted shows ever produced, but clearly hinged on the performance of Charlie Sheen. Ashton is just horrible filling his vacancy..."
Still Rocks!,"May 12, 2020",10,1,2,"Now listen, this show rocks with or without Charlie, I totally accepted Walden as he is and laughed my lungs out. It's hilarious and the constant punch lines about Charlie are really hilarious. Totally worth watching till the end all 12 seasons are fire."
Great show!,"Mar 11, 2011",10,1,2,"Two and a half men is probably the best television show of all time . The cast is superb , Charlie sheen is the main man . The sarcasm and jokes that the writers have come up with its absolutely brilliant as are the story lines! Also the episodes seemed to be getting even better as it progressed which is great considering there has been over 170 episodes ! I am absolutely gutted that charlies been sacked and I hope CBS and warner bros do what they can to get him back and I also hope that Charlie sorts himself out not just for the benefit of the show but for his own benefit as he is one of my favorite actors . I'm just glad big bang theory is still going as that is also an excellent show . Best TV series ever - two and a half men , big bang theory , scrubs , king of queens , curb your enthusiasm , everybody loves Raymond , Frazier , friends , peep show , how I met your mother ."
Good Things Don't Last,"Aug 19, 2017",5,2,1,"Kutcher was a poor casting choice. This is ironic since a big part of the show's greatness was its selective casting from the main actors to the supporting cast. To make such a lousy decision for the lead role was a shocking flub. There must've been personal, not creative, reasons behind Kutcher's hiring after Sheen's departure. Let's face it. Kutcher can't act. But more importantly, he had no chemistry with his cast mates. The show would've been better if they had not replaced Sheen at all and left his spot vacant to leave Alan and Jake run the show. There were many times I wished Kutcher didn't butt in so much.

Did the writers leave with Charlie Sheen too? Some of the lines and jokes were familiar but many new ones seemed forced and dumb. The tone became less subtle and more slapstick. Perhaps the writers were just adjusting the show to Kutcher, who is not good at subtle humor but better at physical comedy. He is that ""wild and crazy guy"" for today. Too bad it's not funny. And I never found Steve Martin, that ""wild and crazy guy"" back in the 70s, funny at all. Only when he relaxed and played someone closer to his real-life uptight personality did he actually become funny. But I digress.

When I read the harsh reviews about the new post-Sheen episodes, I thought people didn't give this new direction a chance. I was wrong. It's really that bad. There were few moments that were funny. But they were few. In the entire first season after Sheen, I must've laughed 3 times. Not even the familiar faces of Alan, Jake, Berta and Evelyn could save it. It was all wrong from the beginning and just got stupid towards the end."
Best comedy series ever!!,"Jul 16, 2018",10,1,2,"I have not seen any show which has so many crazy jokes !! At times, i just can't stop laughing out loud and see any episode over and over again!! Though putting Aston kutcher instead of Charlie sheen didn't go as thought? Charlie is irreplacable but eventually ppl love Ashton.

This show is great,has a lot of fun but with Charlie had incredibly good jokes.. I wish if the show can start over again!!"
Horrible additions: Courtney and Ashton.,"Feb 19, 2018",1,2,1,"Courtney is so horrible. She's absolutely not pretty in any way. She has that ""I smoke 6 packs a day"" look. And yet they made her seem like she was hot. Ashton another horrible addition."
Very good show,"Aug 8, 2020",N/A,1,1,"It was an amazing show the first eight seasons. it could be at the level of friends and Seinfeld, but we all know what happened. Although it wasn't that awful the ninth and the tenth. The last two we're truly awful I will give you that. And the finale I think was a very good way to answer to all the fans. I didn't expect to end like that, I would like to sheen to appear one more time but even though I enjoyed the show"
First 8 are great...,"Apr 8, 2021",9,1,2,I give this show 10 out of 10 for the first 8 seasons. Can't and won't watch this show without Charlie Sheen. They should have just ended this show while it was on top. The chemistry between the characters was unparalleled. Ashton is and always will be in the top ten of all time horrible actors.
One of the best comedy tv series ever,"Feb 19, 2021",10,1,2,"Exceptional humour, very smart and authentic, no coward nowadays political correctness, but only first seasons starring Charley sheen, later they replaced him for Ashton Kitchener and the show was dead"
Two and a Half Off to a Myriad of Possibilities,"Sep 20, 2011",9,2,8,"It was great. I loved it. Admittedly, I have writing in my blood. I suppose the reason I loved the first episode of season nine and look to a bright future of Two and a Half Men is because of all the infinite possibilities now open to a show that had grown a little stale and aged with the presence of Charlie Sheen. It was not all Sheen's fault. The character of Charlie Harper was the same joke week after week. Now the bright and wonderful actors that are Two and a Half Men can shine with a brand new character of great potential in Ashton Kutcher's Schmidt.

Schmidt is a billionaire... meaning he can afford to do or buy almost anything... allowing great writing going forward in being able to do anything... hire rock stars... rent the Playboy mansion... close down Malibu roads for personal racing... attack Charlie and Alan's mom financially... pressure highly placed political figures in their town... etc.

Ashton is probably fresher and better looking than Sheen. His ability to attract women to the show's demographics is being capitalized on by the Johnny Depp pirate grooming of Kutcher's character. Kutcher does have a little to learn about comedy in delivering lines... but the writing is solid. This show has the possibility of bringing Sheen back if they really want to... Rose is no reliable source to Charlie's death... and Jim Morrison faked a death in Paris first. After all... the body supposedly was mangled beyond recognition. I believe Rose sent a bag of meat back to the United States from Paris as Charlie. This will be great as the season unfolds... trust and believe."
I Have Never Seen A Show Crap The Bed This Bad Ever!,"Jan 8, 2015",1,0,0,"Is it me, or doesn't everyone want the slap the crap out of Alan Harper as much as Barney on How I met Your Mother. These ""wanna be Barney Fyfe"" characters just never makes you watch another episode EVER again! - if you ask me. Now Kutcher waivers on wanting to be bitch slapped as his string bean demeanor blubbers over beautiful women prospects. His winy scenarios set in badly timed moral calls just before he is having coitus with a perfect woman who just wants to live in the perfect moment.

The insanity makes me literally scream at the TV because the first 5-7 seasons of this show was really fun to watch. Now its like someone punched me in the gut like Houdini getting it when not paying attention. It's beyond painful to watch. If anyone on that staff actually thinks they are putting out a product for prime TV then their delusional psychosis has set in too deeply to cure. This is the worst implosion of a sitcom ever know to man."
"One of the best comedies I've seen, yet i understand the criticism","May 17, 2011",10,1,3,"Charlie Harper's(Charlie Sheen) paradise life is suddenly spoilt when his hapless and bumbling brother Alan Harper(Jon Cryer)moves in with his 'underachieving' 10 year old son after he is kicked out by his wife Judith.

I have seen every one of the fabulous episodes from this happy and cheerful American comedy. The witty metaphors are a definite highlight of the show as well as the characters lovable persona's. the differences between the main characters are what make this show as great as it is, and no matter what troubles occur with Charlie Sheen in his private life, he will go down in history for his performances on this amazing sitcom.

I love this show mainly because its my sort of humour and has the variety of characters i enjoy. despite this, i fully understand how people could be quick to criticise the show, especially how Charlie's regular sharp tonged outburst's may deter first time viewers from becoming a fan, because i too started out like that when i first saw Two and a half men. Its all a matter of understanding the joke, laughing and continue enjoying the show if its to your liking.

Personally, its a favourite to me, and to many others, but like i said i understand how Two and a half men could be criticised.

P.S throughout the series history, Berta the obnoxious housekeeper (played by Conchata Ferrel) was always my favourite character mainly because her hurtful comments towards all the others around her, as well as the nicknames she came up for people... I will always remember her for naming Alan 'Zippy'"
"Yes to Charlie S, No to Ashton","Aug 16, 2023",5,1,0,"This shows was actually made interesting by Charlie but since he was fired after season 8, I couldn't continue watching it. The entry of Ashton was utter boring and did have any context or meaning after the death of Charlie in Season 8. Bad move by the directer. Also Jake growing up was borong to watch as he's behaviour was intolerable and annoying for the viewers and Alan being Alan was boring on it's own. Charlie was the main character from this show and without him the show doesn't have the same energy it had throughout all the 8 seasons. Only if the creators thought of a good way to implement Ashton without changing the context would've been a good move on their side."
They found another HALF MAN but too late....,"Dec 5, 2014",N/A,1,1,"I won't bother telling you the premise of the show since it's on for more than a decade and during that period it changed a lot, not only because the departure of Charlie Sheen.

So. What's left of it in its latest and final season? Well. We pretty much established that Alan is a dreadful freeloader (after a million jokes based on that), but the show keeps coming with the same material. The way I see it, after the departure of Angus T. Jones they had problem to be faithful to the original concept. So, after a couple of testing with characters like Charlie's daughter and the other fat computer geek kid (who somehow resembles to ""Jake"") they decided to go for a really ""half man"". A new kid.

Mind that I suspect an ""emotional"" series finale because of that kid. The house will still have 2,5 men living in it.

So. Is it entertain? Hm. Cryer had a significant bigger role after the departure of Sheen. He tries too much to justify his 750K+ salary per episode. Is he funny? Well, I let you decide. Kutcher is not funny in this one or in general. So far he was more like the vehicle for humor. Not the comedian per se.

Anyway. The series served its purposes. It make some people laugh for a few minutes, and other made millions, bought private jets and made fortunes for many lifetimes. So, yes! This is a successful series."
It got all ruined after Charlie got fired,"Oct 12, 2015",10,1,3,"F*ck the producers and actors who dissed Charlie Sheen in these series.

He made it awesome and the last two episodes just ruined everything.

All a can say is Charlie getting fired is the worst thing to happen to the series.

I liked Ashton Kutscher until he tried to Diss Dharlie and all went terribly wrong.

F*ck You very much

What I'd like to see,"Mar 21, 2007",10,1,3,"I absolutely love the show, but what I'd like to see in a future episode is a dream sequence in which the show fades back to black and white Mayberry. Charlie would be Andy, Allan would be Barney fife and Jake could be the Opie character. Jon Cryer would make an absolutely perfect Barney Fife. While we're at it, why not make Berta into ""Aunt Bea."" Thanks to perpetual reruns, there are still lots of people who remember the Andy Griffith Show. If the opportunity presents itself, maybe the producers could get Andy Griffith himself to act in the episode or at least do a cameo. I think it has the potential to make a hilarious episode, thanks."
Only because of charlie,"Feb 7, 2021",10,1,3,10/10 till 8th season and after 8th season can not care less
Pre & Post - Charlie Sheen,"May 8, 2022",5,1,0,"It's hard to write a review - the episodes WITH Charlie Sheen are a marvel, I'd vote a solid 9/10.

However the episodes with Ashton Kutcher, as one reviewer said it best - ""sucked balls"" I'd give this part less than zero.

Because there's no 'pre & post' option, I'm forced to rate this show down the middle 5/10."
"Was best written TV show, now ruined.","Aug 28, 2013",10,1,3,"I'm gonna split this review in three.

First review for seasons 1-8. This show was probably the best written TV show, everybody loved it. My whole family watched it every time it's on TV. I even had, for like a year, the same haircut like Jake, a was ''obsessed''. It was about two brothers living with a kid, and how they were growing up, Jake from a kid to adult, and Charlie from being womanizer to an actual person who can be in a relationship. Alan was pretty much the same. And this show had great jokes. You need to watch the first 8 seasons, you're probably laugh out loud few time per episode. 10/10.

Now the review for season 9 and 10. Season 9 was pretty bad, i watched it once, and a was always hoping that the episodes are gonna be better. But it didn't. It only got worst. And when i heard that there's gonna be season 10 i was pretty sure that they are going to ruin this show. And, sadly, they did. Season 10 had like 2 ""funny"" episodes: I scream when i pee and Run, Steven Staven. Run! And in none of those episodes i was laughing out loud. I don't really know how did the ratings stay high. I mean this show wasn't even about two brothers and a kid, it was about one rich guy and one poor guy and a horny teenager who shows up in few episodes, and mostly with skype. And even eleventh season is going to come out, this September. I think it will be lame. But i really want this show to succeed. I give this two seasons 4/10.

And my final review, the whole show: 7/10. I can't give it 10/10 because of those last two seasons."
Watching this show in 2023,"May 19, 2023",5,1,0,"I am watching this show for the first time and I do it while doing my cardio training daily, I enjoyed a good laugh for 8 seasons... than I tried to watch it past the Charley Sheen exit, but in 10 episodes I barely laughed 4-6 times at it was barely a heh.

I am not a fan of Charley Sheen, for me he is the personification of everything bad in Holly Wood but you can't deny he had charisma and like it or not his acting and delivery can make you laugh and I did laugh a lot of times in the first 8 seasons.

Now Ashton Kutcher was probably the worst choice for a replacement, the role itself makes no sense he is a rich 30 that is some kind of savant programmer with the mentality of a child but he was smarter then everybody at MIT...

The humor is crude and somehow all the past their prime cast is now drooling over this guy just because he is rich young and is gifted by nature, basically Charlie but with the mental age of a child ... which makes it the whole show creepy.

Also they missed the opportunity to grow Jake and show that despite the bad role models he actually gets motivated and surpasses his family.... wrong he is still the fart joke and failure in school... really ?"
The Show,"Apr 11, 2006",N/A,1,1,This show is off the hook!i love the show!i watch it every Monday night!but the thing is it's only for people 12 yrs or older!some of the jokes they make have are too mature for young children!this show is amazing!but i wish Charlie and rose would do something together!also there is a little too much action for young ones!so watch when kids aren't around younger than 12!if you don't love or like this show you have serious issues !NO just kidding!but truthfully the first time you watch you'll want to watch every Monday and laugh your head off!also some of the episodes have so funny plots and there SO weird its funny! go 2 and half men you rock hope this show stays on longer than friends.yeah!woo hoo!
One of the best sitcoms out there,"Jul 5, 2007",9,1,3,"I would like to tell everyone here that this series is a great series,i have seen every episode at least twice and i am really looking forward to the new season.

The story in 'Two and a half Men' is one that is really easy to follow, Alan has his own problems with Judith, Marriage and alimony, Charlie is getting paid a lot for doing very little, so it's funny to see how laid back Charlie is and how stressed and compulsive Alan can be.

Overall, a rating of 9 stars is entirely justified, because there is actually a story to tell here and because all the actors, including the kid Jake (who is sometimes very funny) do their job very well, it is a real treat to watch. see it for yourself and you will be hooked forever!"
The newer series are good!!,"Aug 15, 2019",10,2,13,"I love the new series with Aston Kutcher in, prefer the last 3 series to them all! Alan is so much funnier, he makes me die. It's also entertaining how Walden is a billionaire.

I find the last three series a lot less boring and easy to watch, much more modern and fresh.

Wish there was more!!"
Loved the Ashton's seasons,"Dec 3, 2018",10,1,4,I have all of the seasons of Ashton Kutcher on Two and a Half men and only two Charile Sheen seasons.Why??? I thought Ashton was funny and classy and not always needing a drink to function so I loved his seasons more. I love that 70s show too but this is truly brilliant and a wonderful series. Love it... A true gem to watch over and over again!!!!!
Stupid should be painful,"Jan 16, 2014",1,0,0,"I truly cannot tolerate watching this show on television. I find it crude and simplistic, the only way I know how to laugh is when the audience laughs... and even then I only know that a joke was intended. The humor is painfully sophomoric and bland. And this is before Charlie Sheen left the show, Ashton Kutcher can't decide if he wants to be Kelso(from That 70's Show) or himself on some random day. Acting isn't a strong point, neither is humor, so what point is there to this show? Sometimes simplicity is good, less to think about. Still, it dumbs down people and lowers expectations for the rest of us. Mediocrity is the new norm for TV thanks to Chuck Lorrie."
I DEFINITELY recommend that you watch this show,"Jun 9, 2013",10,1,4,"I've watched all the episodes and I still watch them.

I love this show! It's an amazing mix of dirty humоr and amusing 'real life' situations. It's very enjoyable for a laugh and some fun! The entire show appears to be dedicated to making the audience laugh at the character's dilemmas and it is very amusing to see how everyone's situation entwines and makes into a large but hilarious plot! The entire cast is very amusing and their voices, attitudes, appearances and body language portray their characters to their full potential.

I DEFINITELY recommend that you watch this show. At least watch several episodes to get a taste of it. I can almost definitely guarantee you'll be hooked!"
My Advice is to Stop waching after Charlie Sheen leaves,"Sep 12, 2018",4,1,0,I have to agree with many of the posters here. Once Charlie Sheen leaves the show goes down hill rapidly. I did give it a few episodes with AK but the characters just don't make sense and it is obviously just an attempt to wring as much cash out of a dead show. Whilst Alan and Charlie were bound by family bonds there is no reason why Walden would have anything to do with Alan. Also as the time goes by Walden would definitely meet better friends than Alan. Once the premise that they have to stick together is destroyed the whole plot falls apart. If the writing had been better than that might have been helpful but it seems all the comedy writers left with Charlie Sheen. I assume Chuck Lorre thought no one was bigger than the show but in this case Charlie Sheen was
Numbs the Mind - Proof that our Society is in Decline,"Sep 18, 2009",N/A,2,5,"This show is just awful.

First off, the guy who plays Charlie Sheen's brother can't act. He just can't act. Plain and simple, his character has no depth at all, he's just an annoying prat, and he still can't act his way out of a paper bag.

The fat kid is also annoying. The only reason I have watched more than one episode is the hope that I will get to see his character killed off in some sort of a pizza eating accident while painfully trying to deliver one of his oh-so-telegraphed-I-say-""here it comes""-every-time-he-opens-his-mouth, painfully unfunny ""jokes"".

I've never minded Charlie Sheen but I also don't see the draw. He's a mildly talented, friendly enough, good looking guy whose dad is famous and who blew a lot of money on drugs and hookers. Interesting stuff, but that doesn't automatically make him a star or his show a winner.

If you can't see the jokes coming at least twenty seconds before they actually spit them out, this must be the first comedy show you've ever seen. If it wasn't for ""According to Jim"", this show would be the worst, most poorly executed, most formulaic sitcom of the last twenty years. It is a terrible show and anyone who enjoys pathetic drivel such as this needs to seriously think about seeking professional help, or at least developing an adult level sense of humour."
Okay I Just Love This Show!,"Jul 8, 2015",10,1,4,Alright I am crazy about this show I just love it I had seen The Big Bang theory Seasons 1-7 and I liked knew that I love the Chuck Lorre so I wanted to try a second and new show for me of his and it was when Two and a Half Men had like just ended or a couple of months after it so I went to down to my local Used DVD store and bought the Season 1 and they did not have Season 2 so I went way ahead and bought Season 7 and watched Season 1 Episode 1 or the Pilot or whatever the heck you want to call it! And then I was hooked like by the first one or two or three four five minutes of the show or something like that. So yeah I love Jake and Alan and Charlie and even Walden!
Excellent!!!,"Apr 7, 2008",10,1,5,"I love this sitcom. It is not as pretentious as many other American sitcoms. The relationship between Charlie and Alan has the feel of the Felix and Oscar in The Odd Couple.

Unlike most American sitcoms the characters don't have idyllic lifestyles. I used to like Frasier, but I found Frasier an Niles annoying because they are so pompous. Charlie and Alan are more down to earth and likable

I love the character of Rose. She is hilarious, like a less annoying version of Janice in Friends.

Two and a half men has improved greatly since it began. The characters have been developed well and the story lines are getting much better."
A lot better now,"Apr 28, 2012",8,1,10,"I was never a big fan of this show even though I would watch it from time to time. But when they got rid of Charlie Sheen it made it a lot better. I always thought that Sheen's acting was a bit forced and fake. I simply didn't buy into his acting. Even though he was a lush in real life there was still something phony about Charlie. However at first I was highly skeptical of their hiring Ashton Kutcher he actually turned out to fit right into the show as well as give this show new life. I actually wish they could have used Ashton in instead of sheen all along. But back in 2003 he would have been too young. The sad thing is however it seems like Jon Cryer is slipping past his prime as well as some of the other actors. Though the show resonates with perfection now, but is it too little too late??? Im not sure. All I know is that I find that I like this show more without Charlie Sheens phony acting. He never resonated with the show. Sheen felt more like a puzzle piece from another puzzle that they forced to fit the show (with a hammer). Like I said, I was skeptic of Kutcher at first but he seems to fit in perfectly. Ashton seems more natural and believable. He even resonates better with Jon. I'm still not a huge fan of the show but I think it's a lot better now. Also Ashton is a lot more masculine than Charlie. For example Sheen's attempt to act masculine didn't ring true. Always crossing his legs on the couch, acting like a bitch all the time. I know that was part of his character to be a sarcastic punk but he didn't come off as masculine so much as catty. Whereas Ashton's playful persona comes off as masculine, though more boyish than manly. Charlie seemed more like a lesbian trapped in a mans body... and even then I've met lesbians that can pull of the masculine act better than Charlie Sheen. I say goodbye to a bad choice. I believe that it was Jon and the other cast that obviously held up the show to begin with. Now the show is even better with a superior choice of Ashton Kutcher. Before I would have given this show a 4 out of 10 stars (though I liked the premise from the start) but now I give it at least a solid 8 out of 10."
Great show if all you want is to see some skin.. otherwise.. not worth watching.,"Jan 2, 2014",2,0,0,"If you are looking for the TV show that will sink to any low it can, to get an audience, this is the one for you.

Never is a show aired that does not contains nudity (the most you can see on broadcast TV anyway) and the most diverse sexual behavior or bathroom humor.

While I love Chuck Lorre's Big Bang Theory, because of the chemistry of the people on the show, this show relies more on the people having less clothes than working on the character relationships. At least when Charlie Sheen was on the show, the semi-naked people were shown as a minimum and the comedy was not from people dropping theirs pants every 5 minutes."
"People please, lighten up and laugh!","Apr 15, 2012",9,1,10,"I thought I would save my first review for one of my favourite ever shows. ""Two and a Half Men"" is one of the funniest things I have ever seen and I can't see why people are giving it such bad reviews nowadays just because of a change in cast.

Yes, Charlie was a great character who we all loved and was someone who we always got a laugh out of. However, I think that the show had run it's course by the time Charlie left. All it really was was him telling Alan to move out, and it had gotten a bit stale. Obviously Charlie Sheen left the show in unorthodox circumstances, but I do feel that a change was needed. That doesn't mean I think that Ashton Kutcher is the obvious replacement for Charlie. But since Walden (played by Kutcher) has joined the show, I have sat down and watched pretty much all of the episodes he has been in. And you know what? I liked them. They're a breath of fresh air to a show that was running out of ideas. The people who say they don't like them are not proper fans. Just because Charlie isn't on the show anymore doesn't make it automatically terrible. And for the people who want him back: he's dead. Deal with it and move on! Stop focusing on the negatives and start laughing at what still is pure comedy gold!"
Charlie sheen made it!,"Sep 4, 2012",1,1,0,"Charlie Sheen made it what it what it was. I know it isn't Ashton Kutcher's fault that the show has turned awful, but for Two and a Half Men fans, we have to admit that. Personally, I don't think the show is too bad with Ashton Kutcher, but it's lost it's shine. I just don't think that Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher can replace what Charlie Sheen has made the show. Plus, from the season 9 episodes i have seen Jake doesn't seem to be in it that much. one thing i did like about the new season was the change of the song.

This is the best show!,"Apr 2, 2004",N/A,2,5,"I love this show so much. It gets me cracking up so hard I can't breathe. Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer work so well together and Angus T. Jones is just adorable. Each episode gets funnier and funnier. I think it's topping everything else so far! This show is like Charlie Sheen at his best. They were so funny at the People's Choice Awards. The actors just all go well together and the stories are very entertaining. Even if there is not much to the story itself, the jokes and comments are so funny-you don't even need a story. This is definately my favorite show. I hope it comes back next season. We need more shows with good, clean humor, unlike some of the other crap they show on tv."
yes!,"Apr 19, 2011",10,0,2,"I love this show. Typically, I consider myself to have a somewhat more ""sophisticated"" sense of humor (otherwise known as - educated yet warped sense of humor). I admit, this show is a far cry from my other favorite ""Arrested Development"" -- but, it is hysterical. Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen are perfect opposites. Jake, the kid, is so right-on (I would know, I'm a high school teacher). BUT the very best naughty, hysterical, eyebrow-raising one-line KNEE SLAPPERS and ZINGERS go to Berta, the housekeeper. Even if she doesn't keep a neat house, I'd hire her just for the sexually-charged, cultural-reference quotes. Hysterical.

PS - If you're a modern day feminist like me, you might think you'd be turned off by the onslaughts of beautiful airheaded women that Charlie Sheen always has laying around. HOWEVER, I beg you to remember - that these characters are using him just like his character is using them. Women's rights means the right to take advantage of a handsome rich man with big dark eyes if you so choose.

Thanks!"
Hilarious...please disregard the last 4 seasons,"Jul 10, 2018",9,0,1,"To anyone who hasn't seen this show, please do not take into consideration all of the 1/10 ratings on here if you plan to watch this show. I have been watching the marathon on IFC and am remembering just how funny this show was. The first 8 seasons with Charlie Sheen are hilarious and still very much worthwhile. I feel like all the reviews on here were made after he left the show. Angus T. Jones, Conchata Ferrell, Holland Taylor and especially Jon Cryer all deserve credit as well for making this the great show it was at one point. Just pretend the last 4 seasons don't exist."
Alan always made the show!!!,"Jul 31, 2018",10,0,3,"Alan is the best, and one of the funniest characters ever on tv."
not good anymore,"Jun 27, 2021",2,0,0,Was a very good show with Charlie. The show died with the character death.
Two and a Half Men being renovated,"Jan 16, 2015",10,0,5,"Surely the TV show was good with Charlie Sheen, had his good and bad moments, but what counts is that the story did not stop, and also reveals a great quality, even with Ashton Kutcher, the story continues to surprise, and it's fun to many people around the world, to continue, for many seasons :)

How can they say that this TV show will not have a next season, the CBS should invest in this comedy series gender, everyone can see, regardless of where they are and what they do.

Hopefully CBS will announce the 13ªseason. I hope that many have the same opinion as me, many who see Two and a Half men from the beginning, i think it's another one of those shows, to maintain, for a long time, we'll see about that."
Repugnant.,"Nov 29, 2021",1,9,16,"I've never actually voluntarily watched this shoe, but one scene cat my attention while HBO Max was glitching.

This should be called 2 1/2 Pigs w No Regard For Human Decency.

Let's forget about the sophomoric fart jokes and all that ridiculous stuff; the episode(a) tonight left me aghast. I get that I may be a little more sensitive and civilized then the Trump crowd, and my beloved sister raised me; but I just could not believe how they talked about and treated women. The celebrated the most disgusting and basest aspects of being a man (including blind horniness), and made any sort of female biological process some repulsive, disgusting, unnatural and abhorrent, when really those are best used to describe this show, it's writers, and that troll Chuck Lorre.

All of his shows celebrate nothing but the lowest and basest of caveman human. No wonder this ogre works for CBS."
This show is hilarious,"Feb 16, 2004",N/A,2,6,"I agree Charlie Sheen is hilarious, and the kid and him have great chemistry, but you need Jon Cryer. You gotta have the duckman, I mean...even if he's annoying sometimes, you need him for the plot. I started watching the show because of Jon. I thought Charlie was still filming the show he took over for Michael J. Fox. That show was all about Cameron(Ferris Bueler's...). Anyway, if you've had a crappy day, this show will brighten your spirits. Check it out before they cancel it and put some crappy Dawson Creek stuff or another Idol show on."
a gently funny movie ( good for watching before go to bed ),"Feb 6, 2014",8,0,0,"I am not a native speaker and it is a disadvantage of watching a comedy movie because sometime I can not understand the joke.However, this movie is not too complicate.Secondly, the plot it simple but the thing that entertain audiences is the act of character and how they work with each other,very logical.Thirdly, when Charlie Sheen got fired I guess I will stop watching it but I was wrong,Ashton Kutcher does a really good job of replacing Charlie and in some aspects, his performance is even better. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie for those who are looking for a big laugh after a long day working, you will not regret 22 minutes per day watching it."
Best Sitcom in history,"Aug 4, 2022",10,0,1,"There is no doubt that this show is the best sitcom ever made. Especially the seasons with Charly Sheen are just legendary.

I don't understand the bad ratings. There is reason why this show is by far the most successful sitcom ever made."
For Charlie,"Feb 21, 2011",10,0,1,"Charlie you are my favorite actor, but lately in the series ""Two and a Half Men"" you look terrible.I mean, it's none of anyone you do with your life, but for your fans and especially for you would be appropriate to reflect on your health. I reviewed all episodes many times before and it's easy to show under what conditions are you looking now and how well you looked at the beginning of the series.Last episodes of season 8 were definitely the worst made (ep.:14, 15,16).Look at Rose in episode 14 what expression has on the face before a kiss. It should give you pause for thought. You should show your love towards to your wife again who was close to you at good and especially at hard times.The women with whom you spend your time now will not be with you always and as you said in one episode, to the end of your time ""will come to ensure that you are really dead"":)). I am a big fan of you and I have seen that you appear not so often in the episode anymore. I hope you'll consider these tips and you still will not disappoint fans.

"2 and a Half Men: One Is Good, One and Half Bad, 105600 So Bad !!","Jul 23, 2007",2,11,22,"I know a lot about (Charlie Sheen) and I've watched almost all his previous movies (yes, I did that!). Therefore, I said to myself ""Dear Ahmed, every man, No.. every human being, just deserves a second chance"". So I sat in front of my TV to watch Mr. (Sheen) playing a comedy. A COMEDY! Namely, the most difficult form of acting!! And he is nearly playing himself; that's even more difficult for any great actor, not to mention a man who is rejected by not the moviemakers themselves, but by the whole industry!!

But that wasn't the thing which provoked me..

Anyway I've watched some of the early episodes, and I didn't get it at all, especially when any episode ends, and I finds that it happens suddenly, while I didn't laugh during it or whatsoever. So I said to myself ""maybe it is very short sitcom, and as for the laughing.. it will be in the way!""

But that - also - wasn't the thing which provoked me..

After that, I've watched a program (entitled ""Infinity"" I think) and how all the crew of the series talked and talked and talked about the magnificent, genius, and unique comic performance of (Charlie), and I said to myself, No, I cried a lot first, then I said to myself: ""What were they smoking exactly?!"".

But that wasn't the thing which.. BLAH BLAH BLAH..

The thing which really put me in hell, crashed my patience, and destroyed my capability to understand was that little discovering of mine; when I read that this nonsense stayed on TV for a whole 4 years to date. OH GOD, it's doomsday already!

Does anybody, in their right minds, stand this lousy comedy, with all of that hypocrite actors who say WAW to their failure fellow; the one with the most phony, vacuous, inane performance ever?! Although (Angus T. Jones) is a nice kid, but the ice cold present of uncle (Charlie) made him sick by the same disease: coldness!, and I think his character had the worst writing at all. (Jon Cryer) is very good and the life saver of that sunk by his true talent. Enough to tell you that whenever the screenplays were bad, he could be honestly funny.

So, you'll have one good, one and a half bad, and 105600 - the whole seconds of every single 20 minutes of the aired episodes of all the seasons, till now - which are: absolute PAIN!

PS: Frankly, I stopped watching it early, so maybe, just maybe, it got better along the years."
One of the best shows ever,"Dec 23, 2014",10,0,1,"This show was easily one of the best shows on TV when Charlie Sheen was on it. After Kutcher came, he completely ruined the show. The reason the show worked in the first place was because of the contrasts between Charlie and Alan. Alan was a complete no-hoper, a failure at life and with women, he had feminine mannerisms, he was weak and very annoying. Meanwhile, Charlie was confident, successful, laid back and funny. When Charlie left they replaced him with Kutcher whose character is too similar to Alans.... he is needy, a computer nerd, and most importantly, he is not funny at all.... Really it is a wonder that Kutcher has any career at all, because he is god awful in anything that he has a leading role in. So if you must watch this show, do not watch any show after Charlie has left....."
this show is a terrible waste of time,"Jun 20, 2011",1,4,5,"I would have rated this one 3-4, but I rated it 1 so that I try my best to pull down the rating. Believe me this one is horrible for a comedy.

I have enjoyed American comedies a lot. Friends, HIMYM, TBBT etc. I've even enjoyed American crime/sci-fi/drama shows. I agree after a while the creator of a show start to run out of ideas and eventually the show will be cancelled. This one should have been cancelled after Season 3 at the most.

Charlie Harper is a drunkard. He likes sex. Women like rich, handsome men(true that!). The same thing is repeated so many times.

The only thing more to that is his brother Alan and his Son Jake. And to be honest, there are some incidents involving them which have some substance. And their acting is in fact great.

Adding on, the Charlie Harper is essentially Charlie Sheen. You know him!"
Watchin' it twice!!!,"Feb 24, 2005",N/A,2,7,"This was so good on Paramount Comedy Channel last year that now it's on Channel 5, I'm watching it again!

Starring Charlie Sheen as, wait for it, Charlie! Dead-pan as can be, he plays himself perfectly, or at least other characters he's portrayed as I don't know him.

Jon Cryer does neurotic superbly, just as he did in Pretty in Pink, Hot Shots, etc, etc.

Despite obvious casting, this show is great.

Melanie Lynskey as the beautiful, obsessed Rose, pops in occasionally to add a bit of eye candy.

Angus T. Jones as Jake is brilliant. Just by being not predictably cute!

Watch Two And A Half Men for it's quick and witty script that utilises the actors abilities, as limited as they may be!"
Charlie,"May 23, 2008",10,0,2,the character Charlie seems like its basted on the actor who play him Charlie Sheen this show is so great i hope the show lasts a long time Alan doesn't seem like a believe able character Judith is weird is cant seem to decide weather she is straight of not and i don't even know why Berta is in the show rose is a great person for the show. i cant wait to see what comes next ........... ........ ........... ......... ............ ......... ........... ............. ............. .................. ......... ................. ........... ......... ........ .................. ................... ............... ............... ........... ............. ................
Just because Charlie left,"Jan 19, 2025",8,0,0,"It will be clear 10 if Charlie hasn't left. The show was about Charlie and Alan. Two brothers that are completely dife rent. The most annoying part is when they literally say that Ashton is way funnier than Charlie.

Even tho show is not bad with Ashton, it was way better with Charlie. For me Conchata Ferrell as Berta was funniest character in any tv show. In my opinion, it is better than friends but not complete tv show because Charlie Sheen left and he was literally living his every day life as a Charlie Harper. Also they had really good budget for cars and lifestyle. Everyone should watch this show because it's one of most famous and definetly one of funniest ever."
"The Ashton version is really not a bad show after all, IMO.","May 17, 2012",8,0,9,"Big Surprise! Two And A Half Men has been renewed for another season in 2012-13! The Ashton Kutcher version is really not a bad show, in my opinion, despite it being unfairly maligned early-on. The writing has gotten a bit campier without that fine line, 'jumping the shark' IMO; Alan has become a more neurotic, scheming, weasel freeloader and his son Jake has teamed up with Eldridge, Alan's girlfriend's son, to become a sort of Beavis & Butthead-style sideshow. I continue to watch the Charlie Sheen syndicated reruns in ""historical perspective"", but it's obviously time to move on. Life itself marches on. These 2.5 MEN writers are obviously talented and are up for the challenge of their principal player jumping ship. As of the 5/14/12 Monday episode, Jake and Edly have joined the ARMY! LOL! I can't wait to see how the writers return Jake to Malibu to maintain the integrity of the show's title ""2.5 MEN""! LOL!"
My opinion of the new season of Two and a half men 2011,"Oct 5, 2011",1,4,5,In my opinion they should never had sacked Charlie they should have just stopped creating episodes for a while and let Charlie get clean. I know what Charlie Sheen done by doing drugs was bad and may have thrown a few peoples off him but he really is a better actor than Ashton. The only thing i like Ashton in is his old show Punked he doesn't suite the role in two and a half men. I used to live for Two and a half men had to keep it on the TV every time it is on but now i turn something else on as i don't get the same buzz of the new episodes then i did from the old ones. What i mean is I have seen all the old episodes and I have always got a laugh out of them no matter how much i watch them but with the new episodes i don't

vanity cards & a toothbrush,"Feb 12, 2007",3,3,3,"Chuck Lorre is amazing and has produced some wonderful TV programs. (Some not so wonderful, but I blame Cybil.) Do yourself a favor and record this program, stop it on the vanity card, and get that last laugh at the end. You can also see the cards at Lorre's website. ""At least take out the toothbrush!""

This is one of the best sitcoms on television today. As a teenager of the 80's, I was already in love with Charlie Sheen (Ferris Bueller's hunky junkie) and Jon Cryer (Duckie). Throw in Ruth from Bosom Buddies, Leona from Mystic Pizza and I LOVE the 80's! The characters of Rose and Jake and the archetype ex-wife Judith round out an superb ensemble cast. Their timing and dead-pan delivery make this a laugh riot. Catch the summer reruns, become a fan, and let Chuck Lorre know he is appreciated. Keep exploding the censors' heads, Chuck!"
Time to make a change,"Nov 8, 2011",N/A,1,2,"Time for a dream scene that should have Alan wake up in a sweat to find Charlie sitting at the kitchen table!!! This new format is not working, after watching the first episode with Ashton Kutcher I thought YES this might work but now I am considering not watching again. I have noting against Ashton Kutcher or his acting but the part written for him does not lend to the ethos of the show. The show has lost the element that made it a great show, Charlies womanizing and OTT behavior. Jake is at an age to make it really interesting with him coming of age, this should be a writers dream, Jake and Charlie after the same Girls and maybe Jake getting one or two that Charlie wanted. Please get Charlie Sheen back. They will probably have to see this season out with Ashton Kutcher, and Charlie Sheen making an appearance in the last episode."
Very good but there is a problem called Charlie Sheen,"Apr 30, 2011",8,0,2,"This a great T.V show it is one of the things that no matter what this will always make me laugh.I just have a few problems with it one is that the Alan character crosses the limit of stupidness into a place called ""I hate that guy"" and that makes me want to stop watching.My second problem is that every time the story could take an interesting turn it always return to the same thin over and over again and that crates and unstoppable loop that I sincerely hate in many ways i cant describe.And the thing that i hate the most is called Charlie Sheen without him the series could go much further and be much more durable but the problem with him is that without him the series would slowly and painfully die.

But putting that aside first 1 to 5 seasons are good but the more the season advance the more I hate it so know i am missing half 7 season and a 75 percent of the 6 season.

Well with this you know that at first you would have a blast but as the seasons past the joy and the laughter will decrease over time."
Among the greatest shows on Earth (and beyond),"Sep 21, 2024",10,0,0,"The concept itself deserves mega sexy props. It's sad how the show ended though, especially the last season, which was painful to watch to be honest, and not because the show was ending, but because it was not ending fast enough. However, as long as Charlie Sheen was around, this show put miles between itself and any other show in terms of plot development, acting, and writing. Delicate subjects like the flaws in alimony laws, ups and downs of shared custody, importance of individuality, alcoholism, dynamics of a dysfunctional family and pansexuality, challenges of coming off age, dance of hardwork & luck in life, repentance, and more were all handled craftily. Jon Cryer as Allan Harper is the Godfather of modern day parenting for me. That man taught so many parents how to be the perfect parent. Hats off to the entire cast actually, amazing chemistry. I bet it wasn't easy, so thank you for everything, you made a lot of people so happy and you taught us a lot of stuff."

Jumped the Shark,"Oct 27, 2013",1,3,3,"I watched the latest episode. I didn't even smile once. There was nothing at all funny. It's all about Alan and his crotch. Even Kutcher was cardboard like and not funny. I just don't care about the characters anymore. As insane as Sheen turned out to be, he was the show. Where did the writers go? Why did they hire 14 year old boys to write the scripts?

Not funny in the least. It was better last season, but even then you could see Alan was becoming a real one dimensional tool. There is nothing likable about the character at all anymore.

I'll give it one more shot, but I doubt it's going to change much. Where is Alan's X? His Mother? Why isn't Berta on more? Strong characters they have just abandoned. A shame. It looks like Sheen was right, without him, it's dreary."
It still holds up well for a series that has had 12 seasons and 1 soft reboot.,"Mar 21, 2024",9,0,0,"The Charlie Sheen crisis is truly ending our beloved series. Although it continues in name, it is a completely different series in spirit. Jack's role diminishes until he disappears from the series altogether. While Alan's character used to have reedamable features, he becomes completely unbearable. Although the character of Walden is not bad, after Charlie, he can be a bittersweet consolation at best. Lindsey character does not deserve such a long screen time when legendary characters such as Evelyn, Rose, Herb have been removed from the series with rare cameos.

Still...my country has been drifting from a free place to a conservative country for the last decades. A while ago, I heard someone say that if a group of people in our country were able to grow up in this environment with a relatively free mind from conservatism, it was thanks to TV series like this. And he was absolutely right."
This is my least favorite tv show of all time,"Sep 26, 2022",1,8,16,"I hate everything about this show. It is so stupid! I have never laughed at this show not twice, not once, never. The acting is terrible. The whole premise of this show is stupid nothing makes sense. The writing, oh the writing. Anyone who wrote this show should never write anything again. Now I love sitcoms. Most of my favorite tv shows are in fact sitcoms. But this show isn't funny isn't surprising isn't entertaining it's just bad. One time I found a bunch of two and a half men dvds in the junk, later that day I went back to my house lit a fire in my fire pit in the backyard and burnt them. I saved some sick fool from buying them and watching them. But don't watch this show it'll save your life."
Madness of Murphy 2,"Feb 24, 2005",N/A,2,8,"Please folks ignore Murphy 2's comments. The comedy of 2 1/2 men is as good as Frasier, Cheers and Friends if not better. The 1/2 a man is a good foil for Charlie Sheen and at last we have a funny child in a comedy show. Normally the children in comedies are smarmy, this child however is one for the future. Sheen is a great uncle and his brother makes as good a brother as Niles in Frasier. The comedy is slick and the one line gags are always catching you out as you can't see them coming. A laugh a minute from start to end. Even the theme tune makes you smile. I suggest you give it a chance and watch a couple of episodes your sides will split with laughter, once you've watched a few episodes you'll be hooked."

I don't miss Charlie and feel story goes just fine without him there. But I want to ask one thing. How much is too much! Alan getting humiliated by others and his own self is way too much. Disheartening and shocking to be least."
BRING BACK CHARLIE FFS,"Mar 6, 2021",8,0,1,"I'm giving 8 stars to the S1-S8. They are so funny to watch even repeatedly. To be honest, without Charlie,I never finish watching even one episode of S9 and I would not watch it any more. This show now is dead to me. I'd rather watch the former 8 seasons again and again. I like Charlie, Rose, little Jake, Berta and Evelyn in the show. At first I think this show is just for fun. But as I watch more, I realize that there are a lot of other things that I like which can make people stop to think. Charlie seems to be womanizing and nonchalant to his mother and brother at first. Yet I see a loving Charlie when Evelyn is vulnerable, when he comes into Jake's room to find the sulking Jake who is hiding in his room just because Charlie threatens Alan to move out. Rose loves Charlie so much and she is a good girl. So funny to see her head popping out from the deck. .... This show, S1-S8, is one of the best sitcoms in my eyes."
Poision of Intellect which Glorifies Amorality.,"Oct 4, 2011",1,6,11,"So, Charlie is this rich (deserves a half of a star for the idea of him writing jingles - it could've been such a great idea from where the writers could've pulled out so many great ideas BUT they didn't) life burning drunk, his brother Alan is the leech who's, as it turns out in the long run, even more amoral than Charlie (I cannot decide which is worst - the 2D character Charlie or his vermin of a brother with his ""excellent"" parenting skills!). And, then, of course Jake! He's in the same bowl with Charlie having no evolvement throughout the series what so ever - there's not even the slightest emotion in his acting (I know, I know, emotionless can be a way of interpret a character, but seriously - he's like tiny boy-formed terminator). Everything about this show is humiliating. It's offensive, discriminating, amoral and repulsive in the most unhumorous possible way! Seeing how it has been nominated for 2 Golden Globes (or any awards in that matter), ranked so high in IMDb and being liked by many makes me ashamed of how could people like such primitive humor. I understand, everything doesn't have to be sophisticated and sitcoms are supposed to just throw a joke after another at you, so you wouldn't have to crack your brains after maybe a hard day at work. But there is a thin line where the watcher should distinguish if the jokes are made by actually insulting and mocking (in the core, they are I-took-a-dump-in-your-bed *HAHAHA*) everybody (if you are laughing at these jokes, it shows your approval of behaving like this, I cannot bring myself laughing at them, I'd feel guilty) OR a offensive joke is contradicted with nuances (even if they are barely noticeable) e.g. satire, parodies, irony etc. In ""Two and a Half men"" there is none. It's through and through primitive. However, the other half of my given star goes to Aston Kutcher whom I've notices the fans of the show haven't received that well. For me, if anything, he made the show a little watchable. His character is direct and that man can actually act when Charlie Sheen squinted his eyes and had to bitch as much as he could (oh what a challenge!! - not much acting done there when rumors say that's his character aside acting as well), but Ashton on the other hand makes the show, for me naturally, not that much of a nightmare as it was before. There are horror movies less horrifying how its messages could inflict watchers. In 1932 ""Scarface"" was banned due to the glorification of crime. I would draw an analogue with Two and a Half Men which almost like glorifies and encourages people to being plain, blatant, selfish, unethical, from times even cruel and inconsiderate. I try really hard to not be over judgmental, but this show is ugly, it has no soul, no meaning, no point. It seems to have a mission to laugh people into a state of vegetables where the line between right and wrong's been crossed. I feel like poisoning my intellect every time my brother watches it. I would never recommend it to anyone (I'd be probably too afraid that one would actually like it), but if, then the last season, which I myself watched just out of curiosity wanting to see if it could get any worse or actually be saved. Well, it wasn't saved, but Ashton pulls the ugly bar down a little."
Was really boring earlier but it changed,"May 9, 2018",8,0,2,"I must admit that I really didn't like it at all. Up to 5 seasons. Seriously. Then after a few months i started watching again. Then gradually started liking it. After Charlie the show is not boring as people say. Ashton is also fine. Well, to sum it up. Earlier didn't like it and then gradually started enjoying. Ha!"

Getting Better :D,"Feb 7, 2012",N/A,1,3,"The first little bit of Season 9 was nearly strictly sex jokes and mean jokes at Charlie's expense... Probably because the writers and producers were still mad at Charlie the actor at the time of writing.

But finally the Charlie Jokes are done and really nice character development has begun.

Lot's of people are saying that this season sucks and bring back Charlie, honestly the last 3ish seasons all sucked with Charlie in them.

Episode 9 and on have actually been quite entertaining for me, I could do without all the drug references which seem a little off putting, Jake does not need to grow into a pot head!!!

But more than not I am enjoying this season, and hope it continues to improve!!!!"
Good show.,"Mar 24, 2016",8,0,0,"big spoiler from season 9

I like the show. It is very funny, but the story is not that good. Charlie Sheen, playing Charlie Harper is definitely the best character in the show. Walden Schmidt is cool too, though, but it's just not the same. I like the fact that Alan Harper just stays in the beach house in Malibu. Both, Charlie Harper and Walden Schmidt have issues. Charlie Harper is a pig. Walden Schmidt is a baby. I love Berta, because she is so lazy, but still loved by Charlie Harper, Walden Schmidt, Jake Harper and Alan Harper. I like how Angus Jones, playing Jake Harper plays his character so well, even though he is so young at the beginning."
Idea for show's survival,"Mar 8, 2011",10,0,2,"Here is an idea to keep the same name, and keep the show going for years with new writing. The back-story is that Charlie and his brother Alan were killed five years ago, so we have moved on. It is a comedy, so we don't need to ever know how they were killed, other than it can be referenced in comedic mystery. Jake and Berta have been given Charlie's Beach house in the Will to split. Jake has graduated from a local community college in Piano, and his best friend now takes on the role as the ambiguously gay roommate or dork character. I think that premise might leave the other characters in place, and keep the same set infrastructure going for years to come. But, if Charlie has to go, since the show was based on his real life craziness, then so does John Cryer's character Alan. Set five years in the future, I think the show can open up to a whole new generation / demographic, and new ladies for Jake. With Jake taking on Charlie's old personality, and allow him to continue to grow that role. Let me say, that the show will not be the same without Charlie Sheen, so a new show should probably looked at as a spin-off"
worst show ever made,"Feb 4, 2019",1,3,4,Nearly vomit every time one of the ads comes on tv. Wake up this is pathetic. ZERO stars. WARNING SPOILERS THIS SHOW SUCKS

Ashton is not made for this role. It's all over the place and the content is absurd and weak. They fd up a great show because of Charlie's breakdown. We all have them.

I'd give two and a half stars if I could,"Jul 27, 2019",3,3,4,"I found this show very depressing.

Let me explain the difference between this show and Family Guy: FG makes a lot of jokes on people suffering. For This show the suffering IS the joke.

And the victim is Alan Harper. A straight up nice guy who deserves none of the abuse or misfortunes that befall him. One episode you can take but it just goes on and on with even the glimpse of a break always cruelly snatched away.

It's not exactly high brow but good comedy rarely is for some reason. I'm not saying it was never engaging or whimsical or well characterized but it grates on you before too long because asides from the one punching bag every character is thoroughly unlikable. Including that British woman with the jarring voice. I'm British myself and hate her.

There's only one sitcom more depressing and that's the inbetweeners."
Nice one,"Oct 31, 2009",N/A,1,3,"At the beginning it didn't capture my attention but as I started watching it, it grew on me.

And it's fun to watch over and over again, due to the great jokes and replicas they have.

Another great thing about it was that finally I can watch it with my boyfriend...a rare thing when the opposite sexes agree on a movie:))

Lover the characters, the good jokes. It's really great after a hard day's work, to sit down and truly relax.

So thanks and keep up the good work!, we're looking forward to the new episodes."
Tragic for two reasons,"Feb 5, 2015",9,0,1,"Tragic reason 1. This was at the zenith of comedy; smart writing, great characters and absolutely hilarious. So why is it tragic? Because Sheen left and we can now only watch repeats.

Tragic reason 2. How can I possibly vote and give it 10 stars as I 100% iron-clad believe it deserves when they lump the series with Ashton Kutcher into the same IMDb title. Surly it's an insult to the original Two and a Half men by including the Ashton Kutcher crap which is a completely different comedy of the same name. Talk about ruining a legacy!

At the time of writing the ratings stand at 7.2. This would have been so much higher if were not for adding the last series with Ashton Kutcher. It's a travesty and has brought down the ratings on this, once, wonderful comedy that had me laughing out loud throughout the whole episode."
I stand corrected about my previous review,"Jun 8, 2020",8,0,2,"The show after the 8th season is actually pretty good. I mean, Charlie Sheen was really talented and great and all, but the show after he left was still outstanding. It became a different style, actually less depressing generally speaking, besides without Charlie, Alan Harper had a better chance of showing his unique charm. I think people simply expressed their grudge of Charlie leaving in ways of despising the rest of the show."

A Long-Running Sitcom Sinks Under Crude Humor and Stagnant Characters,"Jul 14, 2024",3,3,4,"""Two and a Half Men"" is a long-running sitcom that garnered significant popularity, but it ultimately falls short in several key areas, warranting a score of 3/10.

First and foremost, the show's humor is often crude and repetitive. The series relies heavily on sexual innuendos, cheap laughs, and formulaic jokes that quickly become stale. While this approach may have initially attracted viewers, it lacks the depth and cleverness found in more sophisticated comedies. Over time, the reliance on lowbrow humor results in a lack of genuine wit and creativity, making the show feel monotonous and predictable.

Character development in ""Two and a Half Men"" is another significant issue. Charlie Sheen's character, Charlie Harper, is the quintessential playboy, and while his antics can be amusing, his character remains largely one-dimensional throughout the series. Similarly, Jon Cryer's character, Alan Harper, is portrayed as a perpetual loser, and his misfortunes are milked for comedic effect without allowing for meaningful growth or change. The lack of character evolution makes it difficult for viewers to form a lasting connection with the characters.

The series also struggles with consistency, particularly following Charlie Sheen's departure. The transition to Ashton Kutcher's character, Walden Schmidt, was jarring and failed to capture the same dynamic that initially drove the show. This shift not only disrupted the established chemistry between characters but also led to a noticeable decline in the quality of writing and storytelling. The attempts to revitalize the show with Kutcher's addition felt forced and ultimately fell flat.

Furthermore, the portrayal of women in ""Two and a Half Men"" is often problematic. Female characters are frequently depicted in stereotypical and shallow roles, serving primarily as objects of desire or sources of conflict. This lack of nuanced representation reinforces outdated gender norms and detracts from the show's overall appeal.

While ""Two and a Half Men"" had its moments of humor and occasionally touched on relatable family dynamics, these instances are overshadowed by its numerous shortcomings. The show's reliance on repetitive and crude humor, lack of character development, inconsistency, and problematic portrayal of women all contribute to its overall mediocrity.

In conclusion, ""Two and a Half Men"" fails to deliver a consistently engaging and thoughtful comedy experience. Its initial charm is quickly undermined by its repetitive humor and lack of depth, making it deserving of a 3/10. While it may have found a dedicated audience, its flaws prevent it from being a truly great sitcom."
I Love You Plz Comeback,"Aug 18, 2015",10,0,2,I loved this show. This show was the best on the television for i don't know a decade why do all good things have to end?? i think the time of this series has not came yet there is still a lot more to explore a lot more story line to tell and more of all you could not have been able to ask for a better cast ASTON KUTCHER JOHN CRYER CHARLIE SHEEN(you get my point) and the most brilliant comic producer director television ha ever seen CHUCK LORRE. I think there is still enough steam left to take the series forward for another 10 years plz make it HAPPEN!!! CHUCK LORRE CHARLIE SHEEN now behave like good kids make up and give our show BACK!!!
Worst Theme Song Ever!,"Jan 18, 2013",1,3,4,"There are so many things to criticize about this show...but the one special abomination it shares with virtually no one else is a stupendously amateurish theme song.

One can only imagine the nepotism that must have been involved in the selection of composers for it. The average musician would never be given access to the show's production team...would never get past the secretary and his demos would go into the trash unopened.

For that matter, anyone who did get access would be shot down and told that only the highly educated, seasoned and intrinsically gifted can compose for television...which begs the question, how did we wind up with ""Men-men-men-men-manly-men, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo?""

Like everyone else in America, Hollywood clearly doesn't consider performance in its hiring decisions, just the ""BFF-factor."" As for the show itself, if you've seen one you've seen them all: Chick magnet Charlie always wins, nerdy Allan always loses. Remember those predictable Tom & Jerry cartoons? Same thing here. Rent a DVD of the old ""The Saint"" series instead."
good show,"Nov 7, 2003",N/A,2,12,"What i really like about this show is that Charlie Sheen is sober. I think that him and the little boy make a good team together; i wish that Jon Cryer wasn't in the show, he's just in the way of Charlie and the little boy. Anyway, this is a good show to watch."
"Great, hilarious sitcom!","Jul 6, 2012",10,0,1,"*Written from a 12 year old's POV* I love this show, personally, and I currently own the season 1-8 boxset. The first episode I ever saw, Aunt Myra Doesn't Pee A Lot, really entertained me and I have been watching for the past year. Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones all deliver solid performances for the three primary characters. Created by Chuck Lorre (who also created TBBT and Dharma & Greg), this sitcom does a really good job of gradually changing characters over time, like Jake (the series starts when he is 10) and Charlie (who develops a great relationship w/ Jake).

*SPOILER ALERT*

After Charlie Sheen was fired from the show, it really suffered. Ashton Kutcher (who replaces him) does not do a good job in replacing him. The show is still hilarious, but nowadays I would give the Kutcher era 7 out of ten compared to 10 out of ten for Charlie's era."

Great show,"Mar 30, 2025",8,0,0,"I like all kinds of crazy comedies, but this doesn't take it too far that it gets sickening, and they don't change the characters too much. Charlie Harper was a great character, but I liked it even without him, but my most favorite character of this show is Rose when she makes up all kinds of plots, and they could have used her more in this show. Alan could have been an even crazier character that makes everyone laugh and drives Charlie totally crazy, like the time when Alan stole the gas from Charlie's car and when he tortured Charlie for days with all kinds of lies. I wish they would make some other similar kind of show and add even more funny events in it, like what I previously mentioned."
Worse show ever,"Jan 25, 2019",3,2,2,The worse show I ever had been watched . I wasted my time on this show. I hated the show after the eighth season. All of you know that person who is died which was my favorite actor .

"Pre Ashton good, post Sheen bad","Mar 20, 2012",4,2,2,"Here is the thing about 2½ men. This used to be a pretty good series. I was always looking forward to the next episode. It had a solid screenplay with lots of funny jokes and it all came down to one thing. Charlie Sheen.

I do not dislike or want to discredit Ashton Kutcher in any way. He has been amazing in many other roles. He was the one thing that made me watch the complete set of That 70's show. But, he is no way near a good enough replacement for Charlie Sheen in 2½ men. The reason is very simple, it was originally a series written to fit Charlie. Not only his role in the series, but every other aspect was written to complement him and his lifestyle.

Due to the unfortunate events that unfolded in real life between Sheen and Chuck Lorre they ""killed"" Charlie in the series. And I am not really sure the killed him completely. The only thing you actually see of his demise is a funeral with a closed casket and his clothes hanging in one scene. We completely trust the story Rose tells about this. Maybe this is to let the door be open for a return later on.

Anyway, this series is very much a series worth watching up to the point where Charlie is no longer in the picture. After that John Cryer gets a little bit worse and Ashton feels like a bad fit. The jokes gets to be a bit mediocre and you can actually feel how the series is dying more and more episode by episode.

My personal biggest regret of this whole thing is that I used to rate this pretty high on IMDb, and now I have reduced that rating. This however makes me feel like I in a way diminishes Charlies part of the series."
This show is HILARIOUS!,"Apr 29, 2004",N/A,1,5,"The episode ""Camel Filters and Pheremones"" was one of the funniest things I've seen on TV in a long time! It is definetely worth the time. I never knew that Charlie Sheen was such a great comic actor! Definetely give it a try, if you have a sense of humor, you'll love it! In the episode I'm talking about, a sixteen year old who's really beautiful comes to clean the house with Sheen's housekeeper. They spend the entire time trying to avoid her because ""I'm not even free to take her across state lines"" It was absolutely hilarious! The maid is also a riot. She's usually on the show on about every other episode and she is a really great comic actress. I'll keep watching it!"
"Brilliant, outstanding, amazing, best comedy ever made!!!!","Mar 4, 2012",10,0,2,"Jon Cryer, Angus T.Jones, Charlie sheen and Ashton Kutcher. all you guys are legend comedians and all deserve awards, best t.v show ever made, amazing, 100% pure comedy. love this show to bits, i watch it every day and have got all the seasons, hope you continue to make successful shows and make every fan proud!!!. Best show brilliant amazing outstanding must see 100% pure comedy show is great and always get me in the a happy mood. Charlie sheen made the show what it was until Kutcher came, however Kutcher is a good actor and isn't replacing Sheen but is continuing to make the show successful and this show is what comedy is all about and deserves best comedy show of all time."
People underrated it beyond season 8,"May 18, 2021",10,0,1,"It was hell of a show entirely. I can't deny that upto season 8 ot was pretty good but after that too, it was awesome. I just loved this new Schmidt character. The complete series is greatest of all time according to me."
I love the show and hate the shirts Charley wears,"May 23, 2008",10,0,2,"I love the show! It genially entertains based on day to day life. Real, charming and humorous character of Charley is awesome. All remarks, comment, etc. very much suite the daily routine of a southern Californian. The Characters say what they want to say, the way they want to say it, and when they want to say it. There is no room in the show for pretense, undesired politeness and false statement.

There is nothing better that expressing yourself in true manner.

Yet the ""Tommy Bahama"" shirts are unsuitable with the Charley's character. T-shirts would match the personality and the Charley's lifestyle. In addition, Tommy Bahamas shirts are not popular in LA area. Maybe in Orange County"
now that charlie's gone...,"Jan 24, 2015",1,2,2,"Charlie was the greatest character of all sitcoms! he had the best don't give a s***-attitude, was a sexist alcoholic and the show was great, because of him.

so why trade that guy into a childish, non-alcoholic, non-sexist smart guy? why (season 12) marry alan, adopt a child with him ??? just so the show can be called ""two and a half men"" again ?!? (btw. the show even was called ""my cool uncle charlie"" in German - they had to change it ;))

it used to be hilarious, but I suggest to alter the title of the show, because except for alan (who is getting more and more annoying), and some cameos, NOTHING used to be in the original show..."
The best for me,"Oct 2, 2021",10,0,1,"My favorite series, never stops watching it in a loop."
Shallow and lazy,"Sep 10, 2024",4,2,2,"Hey writers did you hear something called character development? Every episode is the same, every diagolue is misogynist. Characters are never taking lessons and change even a little bit. I quit in season 5 and take a look at a charlie's funeral and I couldn't beleive it. He must be a.protagonist that we love and root for and he is gone, murdered even and there were no emotion on the scene. Some may say it's caricatured, well of course but it stop us to connect with characters and have empathy for them. This show is so unrealistic, monotone, misogynist and not funny at all. I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
Two and a Half makes a Whole!,"Sep 17, 2009",N/A,1,5,"Sydney Channel 9 has been running this show, it seems for ever, sometimes at the rate of 3 episodes a night and at least one episode 3 nights a week! And I still think it's wonderful even if I just read here that its popularity has plunged 18%. Why does it work so well? I guess everyone can recognise something real in this. The whole situation already has nearly everything. Well to do bachelor cruising through life with no problem and women galore, but suddenly has to share his house with his brother and his son(who certainly never belonged, and could be a definite motive for systematic abortion).Yes his marriage ""almost"" ended. Almost because he probably has more to do with his ex-wife than most married man would with their wife! The kid his something on his own as well, food loving and manner less, yet sometimes so appropriate. Our wealthy carefree bachelor is so because he has a permanent care-taker, taking care of everything in the house. And the two enjoy an unusual relationship where it is difficult to see who's the employee or employer as they have a mutual respect despite their own quirky little sides . The ex-wife is terrific, going for broke to get as much as she can from the divorce. These two ""boys"" have a mother whom most of the time they wish they would not have, and they keep reminding you how much they were her last priority. To complete the ""circus"" There is Rose the down-the-yard neighbour. who once was one of the ""ladies'galore"" and will never let ""Charlie"" forget it. Why she keeps appearing like a ghost who does not need keys is part of the fun. But this entire melting pot is a pot of fun. The adult/child mix is wonderful and plays in a parallel plan so the adult acts like adult and the kid too even if occasionally he uses adult behaviour that he does not really understand. But it all fits. In Sydney the episodes were divided with adult session and normal session. For me totally futile as the episodes shown early evening were just as much ""corrupted"" than the late ones. The core of the show is really the script and the chemistry that goes between these two brothers. I feel it works so well because they portray the yin and and yang of society. Those who get it and those who don't regardless of how smart they are. You can pick them in kinder garden yards or in retirement villages. So anyone can associate and relate to this and it's superbly served in the most humorous manner, so you can't hold laughing. But the reminder of the characters is also powerful and complete well this work.

What a shame there isn't something to stop kids to grow older because as this one does grow older, he and the show have lost their candour and the script does not seem to work so well for a teenager. This possibly could contribute to a down in popularity. Just the same give it a go!... 2011 20th of September! Sydney after Charlie virtual suicide has disappeared from the show some months ago and we were promised a replacement. Pardon me if you can but I was much prejudiced about a replacement - it seldom works (Here for my own experience, I would make an exception for ""Insperctor Rex""). So today we got the serve! A little in the manner of the 10 year anniversary Of N Y Twin Tower tragedy only 11 days ago(also that was announced as ""the event that changed the world for ever""! ( I can think of a lot of places in the world that would be very surprised to hear this, especially those starving to death in several part of that very world....) Anyway our TV, Radio and a few other media associations trumpeted the event as ""ultras special"" I was somehow sorry to see this show deteriorated and almost sabotaged by the very person who in my view made it so successful. So I kept an eye on that half hour, yes I was not open to it and so my expectations were entirely fulfilled. For me it was nice to see for a last time this team I enjoyed for many months but alas I found it truly to slumber into mediocrity. I think Charlie's exit would have been more appropriate with a suicidal note and apology to the would be ""survivors"". I don't think this show will survive so an apology would have done justice. How nice for a while I won't fill compelled to watch anything as a must. Good luck for those who still will something to laugh about it."
Loved the second half more,"Oct 14, 2018",8,0,3,"I had it rated as 6 for Charlie's humour but I changed it to 8 cause I found the second part with Ashton Kutcher way funnier. It's probably a non offensive kind of humour which is more my style. Overall great, light series to watch."
Good show even after season 9 too,"Sep 21, 2021",9,0,1,A good show even after Charlie Harper died. Do not measure by ratings that they have given after season 9.
Hi Mr Horned One,"Jul 17, 2019",10,0,1,"By far the Best Comedy episode I have seen since the last episode of Newhart, when Bob woke from his dream. If you haven't seen this episode try and see it. So many plots tied into each other and an ending that was Brilliant."
"Charlie's Season's rated 9, but then...","Nov 1, 2018",2,2,2,"Ive never seen a show flip totally. I understand why Charlie had to go, but why oh why did the writers then decide to make the show a liberal flag waving advertisement!! Charlie Harper episodes were very much about a man's man, a womanizer, alcoholic and very flawed, but very funny, no politics, and not PC. Then he went! So they decided to make the show the complete opposite, subtle at first, but a slap in the face by the end. Politics mentioned, such as ""you're not a republican are you?!"" (I'm English, I don't care, but I knew where it was leading, or had lead) Political correctness abound, Lesbian daughter/mother, the gay marriage, tons of pot smoking etc. Now, I'm not against these, and done in a certain way it could've been funny, but it wasn't, due to the fact, it seems to have been done for virtue signalling, and making a point. (Hollywood do this to movies and series all the time these days, and they flop big time) Yes Chuck Lorre had a huge problem with Charlie Sheen, but to ruin the whole show to spite him (which he seems to have done) is ridiculous. I'll always enjoy the Charlie episodes, but will never watch the others again, what's the point!"
Hope Charlie has never gone,"Aug 7, 2014",8,0,0,"The seasons 1-8 were really hilarious. As a disadvantage I can think only about that there were times that plot and quotes were one level more predictable that someone could tolerate. Although i do not like Charlie Sheen I must admit that I really miss him from the show. This is absolutely his show and his acting style was more appropriate for the scenario. On the other hand seasons 9-11 were too shallow. I don't even understand the addition of Jenny; they trying to have something from Charlie in the show? In addition, Ashton Kutcher may be a very good actor but I think his role is too boring. Sometimes, he is a wannabe Charlie (see the quotes for Alan). Of course this is a scenario's fault but it is not a surprise; in these seasons, Alan stop working, Jenny does not work and they all live by Walden's money, who is a Mother Teresa and invite strangers to stay in his home and additionally he gives them money to live too. Wow!"
Where is charlie sheen ?,"Sep 25, 2020",2,2,2,This TV series sucks without charlie. Part 1 was a zem....but not anymore
This show is great,"Mar 12, 2005",N/A,1,5,"I've watched this show being filmed and on TV. Jon Cryer helps make the show. It's a great show and the 3 men truly make this show and wouldn't be any good without them. It's a great family show and I would recommend it to anyone!

I've always enjoyed anything Jon Cryer was in. I knew him from a movie not many people remember (Hiding Out). During the live filming of this show, he really helped make it truly funny. He apparently had trouble getting some of his lines correct. While that may not be professional, it make the 4 hours very enjoyable.

If anyone gets the chance to see this show taped, go to tvtickets.com and see this show being filmed. It's worth the effort!"
One of the best shows in the last decade,"Mar 1, 2012",8,0,2,"Two and half men has to be regarded as one of the best shows of at least the last ten years. The comedy value and writing is a level above the rest. The entire cast go together like bread and butter and though the show can sometimes be a little repetitive with the same type of story that continues to circle the show i.e, Charlie drunk and Alan been sad and pathetic etc. However, from episode to episode its very funny and entertaining.

Two and a half men has recently gone through a huge transition with Charlie Sheen getting the sack and been replaced by Aston Kutcher and since that the show in my opinion is slowly declining because the show basically revolved around Charlie and Ashton does not at all do it justice being the new lead,

Nevertheless, great comedy that gets anybody who watches laughing."
I had higher expectations,"Dec 28, 2021",9,0,0,"I heard about the show when it was unfinished i started the show in december 2021 and finished it before the new year, thats how much i loved the show, when Charlie left; all the fun jokes became not as funny, i googled the reason for him leaving and he kinda asked for it, Walden was a pill hard to swallow at first, but then i got used to it, even tho he doesn't replace Charlie at all.

Jake's acting on the other hand became more and more forced by the year, so i get why he started disappearing thru the episodes.

If u are a friends fan, you are gonna enjoy the show at first, its comedy but without the emotions and definetly no tears.

Do i regret watching the show ?

No, but i won't rewatch it, that's for sure."
Best Show Ever!!,"Sep 8, 2021",10,0,2,"Whenever I am in a ""funky"" mood, I look for reruns of Two and a Half Men. It lifts my spirits like nothing else. Fantastic writing and acting. Yes, I am talking about when Charlie and Jon were on the show. Give Ashton kudos for trying to fill Charlies spot, though. He did what he could.... Actually, I think Rose was the best part of the show. Wish we had seen a little more of her....."
Miss,"Oct 9, 2020",1,2,2,"I loved this (season 1-8), then when Charlie got fired it sucked already first episode with Kutcher. Sure the one that fired Charlie regret it totally! (hope the person still til' today can't sleep, 9 years later).

It was years ago, but an repeat came up on TV (season 9), then I started to think of it, and want it back! Have been one of the best and still is (season 1-8)."
9/10,"Nov 21, 2021",9,0,0,"As one of my favorites comedy shows, I'd rate it 10/10 but after Charlie ""died"" it became worse and worse. Killing off the funniest character was not the best idea and replacing him with Walden (took me a while to remember his name) was even worse. Ashton wasn't fit for this kind of role, i hope that's why he played it so bad and his acting skills are better. From an amazing show it became an almost okay one. (Im sorry if my English isn't the best)"
Can't stand jenny,"May 3, 2021",1,2,2,The character jenny is so unlikeable I can't stand her she is an aaaaaass she gets under my skin and makes me sick there is nothing about her that is likeable . When she is in an episode I just want to change the channel...get rid of her.
The casting of this show is comedic genius!,"Aug 2, 2004",N/A,1,6,"Formula for Success: Take the combined brilliance of Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen and mix in the finest talent from ""Bosom Buddies,"" ""Mystic Pizza,"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and you have a show that's fresh, rich in comedic flair, and always entertaining.

As a successful jingle writer for commercials, Sheen plays a bachelor who appears to have it all; that is, before his carefree Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his uptight chiropractor brother (Cryer) arrives unexpectedly on his doorstep, with his 10-year-old son, Jake (Angus T. Jones), in tow. Despite a somewhat tense relationship, they discover that they both love Jake and together agree to create a home for him.

If a criticism of this show had to be made, it would be that the ensemble cast members are not given much chance to display their own comedic abilities. Hone down the stalker profile of Ms. Lynskey, and perhaps take Ms. Ferrell out of the kitchen, and you may find some desirable additional scenes to an already fabulously funny show."
No charlie,"Oct 9, 2018",8,0,0,I would give it a 10 but not without Charlie. Well it was still pretty good but not as good. I've watched the whole series two times now and it always have a big spot in my heart.
How can you stop after a few episodes of season 9?!!,"May 8, 2020",10,0,2,"A lot of people who claim the show died after Charlie should have stayed positive rather than giving up. Initially the first few episodes of season 9 took some time getting used to, but that's expected of the show. After that phase the show became funnier and funnier. That was even when alen harper took his role to a new level. So don't just give up on the show simply because you got accustomed to Charlie."
"Quirky, Funny, Sexy, witty and HILARIOUS!!!","Feb 15, 2017",8,0,2,"An amazing show, very mature and very witty, sexy humour. New celebrity every show, and sexy ones'..... But it kinda ended for me when Charlie Sheen wasn't in the cast. You can actually feel the difference, he was the central character of the show! I wish they make a new series with Charlie Sheen back in action!!!"
A great show if you ignore the latter 8 seasons,"May 24, 2023",5,2,2,"What started off as a great show continued to be fantastic for the first 3-4 seasons before starting a decline. At that point Charlie becomes more and more pathetic & spineless until you've lost all respect for him by season 6. At the same time Alan continuously and consistently grows further insufferable, absurdly ungrateful, and ridiculously greedy. When Chelsea moves in things only get worse and you start to detest every character on the show except for Jake & Berta.

Eventually you stop feeling bad for Charlie and just start to resent & hate him. Neither Alan, nor Judith, nor Chelsea have a single redeeming quality.

Despite Charlie being one of the only halfway-decent characters on the show, his death is both a mercy and the best thing that could have happened to the character by that point.

The only correct choice to make when killing off Charlie would have been canceling the show.

Ashton Kutcher should never have been put on the show, there was no coming back from how much they had already ruined it by that point."
really good show,"Jun 20, 2011",9,0,2,"I really love this show, much to the my brother's Macki Grand disbelief who told me that ""if this were not such a popular show, I would think that something's seriously wrong with you!"" I explained the appeal of the show to me as that of a modern take on ""The Three Stooges"". It's all about the ridiculous situations in which these three fellows find themselves! I see Charlie as analogous to Moe--the smartest of the three and the leader of the group--but still a complete dunce with a completely absurd take on the world. Alan is analogous to Larry--and, as a result, routinely berated and beat up on by Moe. And then you have Jake who occupies Curly's position in the trio--as the dumbest and funniest--but with an uncanny ability to maneuver through the minefield of the Harper household, complete with his dad and uncle's sexual antics. Jake's character is the expansion of a good concept--don't make the kid in the show a precocious jerk (I am so tired of that!)--instead make him an amusing dolt!

The rest of cast is great too--from Melanie Lynskey as Charlie's kooky but good-hearted stalker--to various guest stars as Charlie and Allen's wide range of girl friends. I love the episode where Kevin Sorbo (from Xena/Hercules) plays the dimwitted dad of Alan's second ex-wife (and Charlie's erstwhile hook-up) Candi (the hilariously mindless stodgiest April Bowlby)! And the one where Rose positions herself as Allen's blind double date with Charlie and Chelsea is fantastic! (I am not sure that these two episodes were from the seventh season though) Ryan Stiles is great as the freshly emasculated second husband of Allen's harpyish first wife Judith.

I could go on and on about what a great job the writers and actors do on this show, but I'll stop here. Cheers!"
Misogynistic and in poor taste,"Feb 5, 2020",1,6,14,"First, Jon Cryer and Holland Taylor are great and Alan and Herb are the only characters that I really liked. The show is not funny. The ""jokes"" are a bunch of stereotypes, prejudices and meanness and in very poor taste. Fat characters are portrayed as lazy, gluttonous and disgusting. You know what, there are thin people like that too. There are fat dancers, athletes, etc. How Alan is treated in the show is awful, he is belittled because he is a chiropractor and live with his brother, as it was big deal. Living with your family is a reality in many countries, USA included, some just chose to stigmatize those who live with their parents, mother and so on. There are many ways of life, learn how to respect it. Berta, Charlie, Judith are jerks and difficult to like. Dr Linda is unlikable and annoying. Evelyn is supposed to be difficult, she is the show's villain, the actress does a great job. In a nutshell, the show is full of prejudices disguised as ""freedom of speech"" and humor. It swarms with misogyny, fatphobia, dangerous assumptions and disgusting lines that are nothing funny."
bizarre,"Jan 5, 2018",N/A,2,23,"It is not the most inspired word but it could be a reasonable one.not for describe it but its public. because it is the serie who seems a long chain of improvisations. a teenager effort to refuge in fake universe. accent to sexuality and hate, in remains, in strange way, the serie of Charlie Sheen at whole. a kind of reflection in mirror. in which, maybe, the only good performance remains the work of Conchata Ferrel. so, a serie. like many others. looking succes. and, sure, its public."
Only to season 8,"Mar 25, 2021",8,0,1,Without Charlie the show is wack. Season 1 to 8 were great.
Amazing Tv show just because of Charlie Sheen,"Mar 31, 2021",10,0,2,"I love this Two and a Half Men,only because of Charlie Sheen and the other actors, except Ashton Kutcher, which transformed this awesome Tv show in something horrible."
"I am begging you Chuck Lorre,please, for God sake, stop the show!!!","Sep 2, 2013",3,2,3,"For 8 seasons the only reason I watched the show was only because of Charlie Sheen.It was fun in the beginning.In fact I tolerate Alan Character for whole almost 10 years and now I realized that's enough! I just wasted my time. It is the worst comedy show I've ever seen.Thanks to you chuck! By the way, what the hell they were thinking about changing Charlie- The only sparkle in their business- and increasing the number of boring characters! Jake, Alan and the new guy Walden, they are all some kind of worst chosen actors ever for a comedy show! you know If I were Charlie I would have killed Alan Harper in the first Episode of the show!!! Boring Boring Boring, The best description for this tragedy which changed my mind about Chuck Lorre comedies. Please Chuck go concentrate on Big bang theory! that's a real show. Bye 2.5 men Love u Charlie we missed you so much"
Its like watching another Titanic sink again,"Sep 25, 2013",2,2,3,"The writers of the two and a half men are now drunk or maybe the good lot left with Sheen. I mean its about time they realize that this show is nothing without Charlie. Ashton is making the show pale and distasteful. Charlies fart had more comedy than the entire season 9 and 10. The producers should beg and bring back Sheen no matter what the cost they have to pay.

Recently, another news hit the internet of Angus Jones leaving the show. My reaction was 'you gotta be kidding me', i know Jake didn't bring to much joke on the table but he is still better than Ashton and with him gone only John is left with huge burden to carry the extraordinary legacy of this show. So either they should bring Charlie back or change the title to something else.. like One man (John) and other lunatics or Bunch of fools in Malibu.. I am Giving two stars just for Charlie.. rest eight of them are waiting for him to come back."
"Reply to ""Ruined, 21 September 2011"" by killer1h","Oct 31, 2011",1,2,3,"I do have to agree that this show is now dead and not only have I stopped watching the garbage they are putting out I now do not even waste time downloading this Rotten Tomato! I do disagree with ""killer1h"" because the show was already dead before Charlie Sheen had left; by the crappy writing of how they were destroying his part by writing him as a drunken idiot who not only lost the best girlfriend he ever had, but goes after a married & crazy Rose and then having his idiot brother pulling off a ponzi scheme on almost everyone. Charlie was lucky to get out when he did and he profited from their mistakes! Sucks to loose such a good show that used to make a lot of people laugh, R.I.P. Charlie Harper even though we know that it will be more than just you turning in your grave!"
Truly truly dreadful canned laughter,"Aug 23, 2017",1,2,3,"How did this get the votes it did ?? Canned laughter at it's worst for unfunny drivel.

I can only assume some people switch their brains of when they turn on their TV remotes !

So I have to add a few more lines well here is a few.

If your thinking of watching this then do something else like watching your grass grow.

You will get more amusement !"
Charlie Sheen can't act,"Feb 13, 2020",1,4,12,"Charlie Sheen can't act. Jon Cryer overacts ll the time. Too overrated series. The very first episode was such a bore, watching Sheen was depressing. It took them 8 seasons to rectify that, but it was too late."
Too graphic for me,"May 5, 2021",1,3,8,"Never again will I waste a minute of my time watching this show. Too explicit for me. Personally, I think it should be cancelled."
"This sitcom was about Charlie, Alan and Jake","Dec 10, 2013",1,2,4,"This sitcom is in it's 11th Season, but this show lost it's entire taste way back in the 9th Season, one just cannot digest Ashton Kutcher, he just cannot ACT, and his character has no relevance in this show.

People like Chuck Lore, Charlie Sheen should have patched up together not for themselves but for the people who watched this show around the world. After all they became rich because of this show, there was absolute no need for firing Charlie Sheen, instead a small pause for a season or two should have been sufficed to let calm down things between Sheen and the Studio. There is nothing in this world which cannot be solved by talking out.

The creator of this show is dragging this series and hoping that people would forget Uncle Charlie, and they have been unsuccessful in doing so.

This show is total waste without Charlie Sheen, there was a impeccable balance between Charlie, Alan, Evelyn, Jake, Judith ... if the producers really want to earn some good money then the only option for them is to get Charlie Sheen back.

""Ashton Kucther"" just cannot ACT ...and what is he doing on this show !!"
Love Charlie Harper!! The Rest Sucks!!,"May 15, 2020",2,1,1,"The show is just brilliant the first 4 seasons. The next 4 seasons are really good. But they should have seriously ended it as soon as they kicked out Charlie. You can't make it past the 1st episode of 9th season. Charlie Harper is what this show made it what it was, and the bickering between Charlie, Jake and Alan was the beauty of this show. As soon as Jake grew up, the entanglement between the 3 became very less, that's why the the 4 seasons are the best. Still the show was great, but you can't make Two and A half men without Charlie Harper, no matter who you replace it with Ashton or Brad Pitt, it doesn't matter. House of Cards did the same and failed terribly. Why don't the show makers get it before ruining a brilliant TV show. Can't give it more than 2."
Sheen 10*Sheen 10; Kutcher 3,"Jan 14, 2023",3,1,1,"Where do i start. Sheen has been in a long string of great tv & film before he made Two & a Half Men one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. His comedic talent wasn't lost on Spin City either with heather locklear, although most of its reviews are Michael j fox die hards (great actor). 2&1/2 is extremely crass and sexist but that's what makes it so good. Truly, this show is inappropriate for tweens and teens because the sarcasm is lost on them and they would see all this behavior as acceptable, tainting them toward superficiality in their formative years. Very sad to hear of kids who remember this from that age period. Sheen was the perfect middle aged rich guy who had the money and just enough good looks to bed a string of women. The script worked well, based off the 1960s hit The Odd Couple but with the addition of the booted out divorce' having a son and the slob being rich attractive. Most of the actors had perfect timing and great chemistry with the exception of Hinkle (Judith) whose part would have been better with almost anyone else, and Taylor (Chelsea) who was a complete misfit for Harper, lacking any personality and type-casting females as controlling and demanding (and who we had already seen in a number of episodes with different names). Lynskey (Rose) did an excellent portrayal and Holland was outstanding as the overt narcissist mother, Evelyn. Sadly, the decision to keep the show running after Sheen was unceremoniously fired was not done with respect for the show but with the hope that the name would bring in unwarranted profit on its coattails. Kutcher has been successful in his own right but the extreme changes to the premise of the series along with thrusting Cryer into a more leading role (great as the brunt of Charlie's jokes but not a leading actor on his own, and certainly not a comedian) was a horrible mistake. Instead of the bumbling anal-retentive parasitic loafer he becomes a clown who stoops to levels seldom seen in tv while his producers placate him with false accolades. The series veered so deep into the far-left agenda it was absolutely embarrassing. The show would have been better off taking a page from earlier television where a character was simply replaced by another actor instead of killing of the character and rewriting the script. Anything would have been better than the train wreck it became. Huge mishandling. I mean imagine selling tickets for Pearl Jam concert and then removing Eddie Vedder and changing the lyrics to Black because the stand-in didn't have the right vocal tone. My 5 * rating is based on the entire series; the seasons with Sheen would be 10*"
Charlie Sheen,"Dec 2, 2013",2,1,1,"I have been reading reviews here on 2 1/2 Men. It seems there are a lot of Sheen admirers. Personally, I was glad he was gone, 1) because nobody is worth demanding that much money and 2) his character was seriously over done. I was so tired of Drink, Drunk, Repeat that I had stopped watching anyway. Once Kutchner was added, I knew the Drink, Drunk, Repeat would be over so I started watching again. His first few episodes were promising. Then the writers started drinking, got drunk and never returned. Kutchner is suffering from the writing that he's been given and I think he should quit as well, just for different reasons. There's nothing to as about the character ""Alan."" That storyline is older than, well.... me!"
Nothing without Sheen!,"Aug 28, 2018",1,1,1,"I watched this show for the first 7 or 8 seasons. Not every episode but I knew the show revolved mostly around Charlie Sheen's character. Season 9 begins with a new character, a weak character, played by Ashton Kutcher. Wow, are you kidding me? This guy can't act, the best thing he ever did was the 70's show. He's awful... Dull and boring, just as the show became, and it went on for another for years with crap ratings. But I guess that's Hollywood!"
Well this aged poorly,"May 25, 2021",1,3,9,Everyone woman on here is either a crotchety old woman or a bimbo. This show is very degrading to women.
Ashton's 2.5 Men - Must See TV,"Nov 15, 2011",1,3,9,"As may other contributors have pointed out the new season of 2.5 with Ashton is appalling. However, I believe Lorre et al have transcended appalling into 'so bad it's good' territory.

Watching this once mighty show brought so low has the unlookawayable qualities of a 20 car pile up in the opposite lane. I don't begin to know where to start, so lets start with Charlie. Nothing could better prove just how bi-winning Charlie genuinely is than how badly 2.5 has gone since his departure.

The blending of of his on and off screen personas only added to his overall legend status, as one wag put it ""when I die I want Charlie Sheen's life to flash before my eyes"".

Ashton, this guy has none of the charm of our dear Mr Sheen, and frequent references to how rich and handsome he is in the script... comes off as needy and unsympathetic. WWCD?

John Cryer - while adequate playing the straight guy to Charlie's lead just can't cut it as the funny one. No matter how sportingly he hurls himself into the role, he just can't carry the show.

Angus Jones - fat kids are funnier, go to Burger King, Stat.

Script: gone are the one liners, gone the jaded world view and hedonism we all secretly envy. Instead we have physical humour and Ashton taking his clothes off, it wasn't funny the first time...

Production: is it me or have they hiked up the laughter track? Maybe I missed it in the old days because I was occasionally laughing myself. But now, as I sit stony faced mourning a lost friend. the laughter track grates like fingernails on a blackboard.

Despite all of this I would encourage, nay urge, readers to continue to watch the show. As a tragedy it works on a variety of levels, for students of televisionology and humour it must surely be a treasure trove of 'do nots'.

I like to put on an episode of the new season before sitting down to watch 30-Rock, Southpark and other genuinely funny shows. I find it enhances the rest of my evening."
An annoying waste of time!,"Aug 19, 2018",1,1,2,"I hate this show! The characters are annoying and dumb. I think that's my biggest problem with this 'show' is the characters tbh. Charlie is the worst that I end up rooting for him to lose whatever argument or battle he come into contact to! Alan is just bland! He isn't overly mean or nasty he's just really boring! Idc to give this show more of an review because it doesn't deserve it. If you want a funny and fun sitcom with great characters and writing then watch 'Modern Family' not this crap!

This is what should have happened . . .,"May 29, 2018",1,1,2,"After Sheen's character died, he should have come back as a woman. That would have been great!"
God will not approve of this show,"Oct 14, 2016",2,1,2,I absolutely find everyone in this show annoying and offensive. There are real guys out there like Charlie. And the fact they make humor out of stuff like this when you actually know someone who has bad morals and alcohol habits in real life its actually pretty sad. Charlies brother Allan on the other hand may be strait edge but he acts Gay. The house maid in the show is an anti emotion who wouldn't react to your death. Jake is probably the only character in this show that I find funny without being inappropriate. Not to mention I notice the profanity in this show is a little extreme. Shows like this should only be allowed to be watched on YouTube and not be put on TV. I made other reviews to other shows that I feel have similar humor that I don't find very humorous anymore they're just more inappropriate now days. I honestly enjoy the family shows better than the dirty comedian stuff they make out there.
300th Review... WARNING: This Show is NOT Sliders!,"May 3, 2018",1,1,2,"Two and a Half Men is NOT Sliders.

There is none of the action and adventure in this show that you would find in Sliders. None of the episodes of Two and a Half Men involve sliding through wormholes into alternate dimensions.

Charlie Sheen plays a piano and writes jingles in this show. He uses women and makes jokes like ""You want a sausage? I'LL show ya a SAUSAGE!""... he doesn't even do science or open wormholes.

There is ZERO inter-dimensional travel in this show.

You have been warned."
A show that should have ended years ago..,"Dec 25, 2014",2,1,2,"Two and a Half men is a comedy series that followed the all-too- common route of Hollywood sitcoms.. The show overstayed its welcome (after Charlie, the main actor was kicked out) and as the show continued to slide downwards, the producers embraced the race to the gutter and adjusted accordingly; Turning a once entertaining show into a pointless tirade of juvenile humour from an unfunny and poorly written cast who's justification for even being there is sketchy at best..

In the original seasons (we'll call them the 'Charlie days') the show was often crass and crude but well played and relevant. The characters played their roles well and the story lines and dialogue was pretty entertaining. Although the underlying foundations of the plot(s) weren't new themselves, the characters and comedy made it a fresh and enjoyable.

In the seasons that followed though (the 'Post charlie' days) the show immediately went down hill. A lot of the cast was replaced with unfunny, uninteresting and not- particularly-talented actors, and the original cast members were replaced with poorly-written parodies of their earlier selves..

As bad as the dialogue and point of the show became, what made it worse was the (as stated before) juvenile direction the show went into --Endlessly forcing in disgusting puns and frat-boy-esque jokes about masturbation and breasts in as many ways as possible, as if to pad the lacking dialogue. The shows story and new characters were just outright boring and uninteresting and it seemed to become incredibly self- aware of its crap-factor --A show that continues solely to squeeze out the last few dollars it could get out of the audience..in true Hollywood style..

.. At this point I gave up watching, only to watch the odd re-runs on late night TV from the 'Charlie days'. Its too bad how things went, but at least we got a good show for a while..

I would highly recommend the earlier seasons of the show (1-8, I believe) but would avoid anything after Charlies removal from the show. 2/10"
Died when Charlie left,"Jul 6, 2014",2,1,2,"The show was awesome until the fired Charlie, since then it went down and down. Then in addition Angus left, so you have Jon and ""ruin-it all"" Ashton Kutcher, a complete mess. I'm not saying that Charlie was all the show, but he was 90% of it, you got the jokes, the set ups, the characters and everything around him. I haven't laugh a single time during the new seasons, I can't stand the new people involved nor the jokes they do. I'm leaving a 9 out of 10 because of the old days, but right now it's a 2. I don't get how people still like it after they killed the whole idea and added the new ""characters"". I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, or maybe recommend the older seasons, when it was good."
"Heard the phrase, ""It's better than Two and a Half Men""?","Jun 4, 2018",1,1,2,"In our house, when we see a bad T.V. show there's a phrase used so the show isn't complete dissed ... ""It's better than Two and a Half Men"". No one has yet uttered, ""it's worst than Two and a Half Men""."
"Charlie Sheen had to go, but the should have ended too","Jan 2, 2015",1,1,2,"This is one of the best series that I have ever seen. Incredibly funny while Sheen was still there, but he screwed up very bad.

Yes, he was on the reasons (maybe the main reason) why the show was a success, but it doesn't matter how good you are, you can't be horrible human being that make anti semitic comments against the show's creator and think that everything will be fine.

Chuck Lorre had the right to fire him, specially after he had brought Sheen back to the spotlight again after maybe years doing nothing important. Lorre made Sheen a star once again.

That being said, the show should have ended when Sheen left because he is the main star. Not only that, the new replacement (Kutcher) is just not funny and the story from now on (specially the last season) is unbearable to watch)."
Poor Beachside Life Comedy Series,"Jan 4, 2024",1,2,10,This is not a great comedy series at all. Too much was happening throughout the series that it was lost. The crew needed more effort and strength to create this comedy series better. The storyline of the series did not stay in one direction. The cast selection could have been a lot better. There were times that they connected to the storyline of the series. This comedy series takes it past the limit of the multiple aspects of life. Everyone has the freedom of how to live their life. I wish I had that freedom. I will forever be stuck in my life. Everyone who is in my life never let me live the life that I want. I wish I had a real life. This is a poor comedy series.
Season 9 - 12,"Sep 2, 2018",1,1,3,"JUST embarrassing. No one could replace charlie sheen. the show was called 2 and a half men. It ended up as one and a half men, as kutchers role was dire, so childish and well downright embarrassing......

I know the actor who played Jake wanted out of the show, as he was fed up with the way it was going and did not like the fact it was turning more and more into the how many times can you have sex and masturbate show. I found it awful actually from towards end of season 8 onward it was all about alan harpers need to constantly masturbate.

No the show jumped the shark, and the shark should have just swallowed it whole ugh, i only watched bits and pieces of 9 - 12 and the ending was absolute rubbish awful. cringe worthy.

OK charlie sheen had issues instead of throwing him out the producers could have helped him more and perhaps even put the show on ice until he recovered. They should have just finished it at season 8 with perhaps all 3 going in an explosion because the show sure as hell imploded when Ashton Kutcher turned up."
another one bites the dust,"Jan 17, 2019",1,1,3,This was one of the funniest shows ever Charlie & Jon had perfect comic timing & chemistry hhhmmm what was I going to add....ahh that's it...ashton YOU SUCK
Ruined since Season 9.. I need some Anger management!,"Mar 9, 2014",1,1,3,The show was Perfectly fine until Season 9. Charlie Sheen made his character so irreplaceable.. The Show successfully kept viewers interested and entertained.. It was always the actors playing their characters and their skills of portraying the jokes.. But now i feel that the show should be canceled immediately... unless things change and Charlie Sheen is brought back.. which wont happen.. so we can all kill that hope. The Fans are unhappy. Your show totally sucks now. It is going downhill from Season 9.. Ashton kutcher may be a great actor.. but he does not fit in this whole scenario.. Worst mistake of trying to renew for another season with a complete Abrupt storyline.. Stupidity! I'm just happy i can laugh with some anger management.. :)
one or other.,"Dec 4, 2013",1,1,3,"Mr Lorre, please bring Charlie back to the show or just wrap it up. It's obvious that the people want a Charlie back to the show and its a pain to watch your show as it is now with Ashton as much as I like him in movies I cant stand the show at the moment and is only one way to make it right and you know how Mr. Lorre. I personally don't think that Charlie is only about the money you should all really use some help to start a conversation, and forget for the five minutes about your issues to the other because you can all get more than you would invest and make a lot of families world wide happy too. Charlie is doing well now and I am 100% positive that he think much clearer now, do it for the people bring back Charlie. Every one make mistakes but you shouldn't turn back on him because you make him look like rich, drunk and womanizer type and he took it beyond and that was a thin line that he crossed, and you helped him a lot, we all let him down because he was asking for help, really way out to do it but it was, he was drunk, stoned and left alone with his problems and only thing we did was watching a mans life getting rip apart as a part of the show and that was wrong. Im glad that he is doing well now because I know for the fact that is the every day struggle. We love You Charlie."
stinks,"Mar 5, 2014",1,1,3,"ı used to smile and laugh out loud when Charlie was on, now with Ashton kucher its painful to watch. Its as if the writers have changed. there's more characters added to the cast to makeup for the paltry scenario and last episode I watched I didn't even smile once. I have been watching it out of loyalty for the old show but at this rate, I will stop watching. After Charlie left Alan harper character went to pieces as well and is now a loathsome leech that makes my skin creep. The whole thing is sad..... It is now a disjointed series of sitcom clichés and totally uninteresting new characters each one more forgettable than the last. It is forced and uninteresting and totally unfunny. Cme back Charlie all is forgiven."
It's the same thing every day,"Sep 4, 2020",5,1,3,"Charlie Sheen wakes up in the arms of a beautiful ditzy woman. Some stuff happens. Charlie decides he wants to sleep with some other woman. Witty dialogue ensues between lower cast mates who seem genuinely decent, and then Charlie gets another woman.

I would catch this on syndicated reruns for a free months on my local FOX affiliate, and then I wondered, does Charlie ever not act himself? The other characters are decent and seem interesting, but I just couldn't get over that disgusting subplot that never changed."
Hit or Miss!,"Oct 31, 2008",5,1,3,"I like this show and hate it at the same time. I will start with what I dislike about it. Charlie Sheen's character is totally a Hollywood creation. He is a not very good jingle writer, who happens to have a beautiful house on the ocean and dates a supermodel per week. How fake. In addition, he drinks and pretty much bums around. That sends a really fake message to the audience. I also think that some of the jokes are really bad and in poor taste. I don't see much in Conchita Farrell's character. She is totally uncouth. The boy is annoying. He eats all the time, and has bad manners. The Mom is too narcissistic to believe. She is a really awful person.

What I do like about the show is that there is a lot of entertainment. Jon Cryer's character is funny and realistic,because he is a nice guy and gets the worst of it. His wife uses his niceness to get more alimony and to look down upon him. Charlie Sheen is a funny comedian, and has a lot of good lines. Sometimes, the comedy is insightful about how shallow and petty Hollywood's city can be. So, it is hit and miss. On a good episode, you will be laughing hysterically. On a bad episode, you think what junk."
"Nothing, but a Lame Copy of Friends!","Oct 10, 2013",5,1,4,"Two and a Half Men might be on air for about a decade now and still counting which is potentially the sign of success for a TV show, but me: Not even close to the word success! Give me a break to walk you through the whole picture.

For one thing, the main characters are two unevenly matched brothers and a little boy. The brothers are miles away from each other and cannot be any more distanced. The little kid is fine out there, but he's just a kid you know all of what he's got to make the audience laugh is the cuteness, rudeness, and of course intelligence that certainly fades away at the end of the very first episode. So, just the two men, then!

Firstly, they're not characteristically robust for a 10 year-old TV show as they lack those unique exquisite role features and all making them very one-dimensional unattractive couple. Secondly, the number of characters is too small and all the time you have to stare at two brothers who are either fighting or running to their mother! Thirdly, the producers have tried to pump in comic lines to every 2 lines of the show that makes half of them boring and predictable.

For another and more important thing, you can find similarities between this show and the late sitcom of Friends. To start with, the sissy brother barges into the other for help and shelter in the pilot as Rachel had done on Monica almost 10 years ago. Besides, the guy's wife is divorcing him as she has recently found out to be a fruit which was the case with Ross and Carol. What's more, Charlie Sheen impersonates a charming guy who is dating tons of women and never calling back that brings us to the character of Joey by all means. The creators of the show have tried to remake a new Joey Tribianni, but alas. Joey is lovely, Charlie is definitely not; Joey steps up for his friends whenever needed, Charlie is very self-involved; Joey is pour and cannot even afford to live alone, Charlie seems to be one of the richest guy in the city; Joey is totally and truly an everyday personality, Charlie is a head-in-the-clouds weirdly rare piano player; Joey is all warm and laughable, Charlie is never even close. By all due respect, Charlie Sheen could only be bearable as a guest star in a comedy show which he did on Friends illustrating Phoebee's sailor boyfriend catching chicken pox, but not in his own show!

Also, it is beneficial to read straight from the horse's mouth. Angus T. Jones (who plays Jake) has uttered that: ""Jake from 'Two and a Half Men means nothing. He is a non-existent character. If you watch 'Two and a Half Men,' please stop watching 'Two and a Half Men.' I'm on 'Two and a Half Men,' and I don't want to be on it. Please stop watching it; please stop filling your head with filth. Please. You know, people say it's just entertainment. The fact that it's entertainment...do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you you'll have a decision to make when it comes to television, and especially with what you watch on television. It's bad news....I don't know if it means any more coming from me, but you might not have heard it otherwise. Just watch out. Watch out. A lot of people don't like to think about how deceptive the enemy is. He's (the devil has) been doing this for a lot longer than any of us have been around. So we can't play around. There's no playing around when it comes to eternity.""

For what I see, the show has failed to make me even smile after 6 episodes let alone the concept of laugh. I just hope I would be stubborn enough to go on till the end of the first chapter to see if anything changes or not."
"repetitive, uninspired and lazy.","Nov 1, 2021",3,1,4,"This sitcom felt like such a good premise the first few episodes or so. However the characters never grow on you or the storylines manage to surprise you. It's the same set piece over and over again. Even within the boundaries of a sitcom more creativity can be expected. Instead we get predictable jokes aimed at teenagers, even below the levels of comedy lows such as according to jim. Childish."
I get it!,"Oct 20, 2011",4,1,5,"Do you have an exceptionally high tolerance for the same droning sound over and over? (Mennnn!)

When I first heard this was Americas number one sitcom you really got me Ashton, but I get it, we're all being punk'ed right?

Better than The Big Bang Theory. Seinfeld is still Sitcom King.,"Jul 26, 2020",5,1,13,"I didn't like or Hate this show.

The premise is very relatable and was good. I wasn't able to click well with the show. I have nothing negative to say about it. The Characters are indifferent and whacky which made this show work.

It had a long run which is rare nowadays.

Verdict: I don't hate or like this show. I do respect its success."
The Comedy of Macho Men,"Dec 13, 2014",4,0,0,"This show follows a drunk billionaire and his lonely pathetic brother and dumbass nephew, who will grow up to be even more stoned and pathetic than the two former. Charlie mostly portrays himself and relies constantly on titty flavored jokes while his brother spends his whole free time masturbating. While some good laughs may definitely emerge from both perverted and non perverted (call them as you will) viewers I personally don't see much appeal in these characters outside of their worthless jokes. Later episodes with Ashton Kutcher in the place of Charlie even more so rely on us laughing at the mention of balls and pot brownies (which the younger character is often stoned off of.) You might learn some facts from this such as there is not a single bone in the penis. If such knowledge interests you and all you want to hear is polluted sex and crap jokes than this is definitely a show for you. Crack up with balls in your mouth with this show if you like. There are some funny moments (I just don't remember any at the moment) so I will give this at least a 5 or 4 for having a somewhat amusing Charlie Sheen."
Should've kept Charlie Harper,"Nov 14, 2020",5,0,5,"I sat through every episode of Two and a Half Men in it's original run and I can say, no question, it should've been canceled after season 8 if the producers couldn't talk Charlie Sheen into coming back. Or recast with someone that closely resembled Charlie Sheen, like John Stamos.

Yeah, it did get repetitive after a while (Charlie's drinking and womanizing, Alan's mooching and making bad decisions in his life, Jake being perpetually stupid, Judith being perpetually angry and frustrated, Berta being sassy, Evelyn being narcissistic, Rose being funny and cutsey one minute and uncomfortably creepy the next, etc.), but it still had occasionally funny moments. But killing off Charlie and replacing him with wealthy tech guy Walden Schmidt was the worst idea ever. Walden did not fit in to this show at all (Kutcher ain't much of an actor either). The last four seasons were the worst.

Even the series finale was a huge bust!! WTF were they thinking? Making us thing Charlie Harper (not the real Charlie Sheen but some dude that looks like him from behind, complete with bowling shirt and baggy shorts) didn't die but was kept prisoner by Rose, then escaping, only to get killed by a falling piano in front of the beach house??? I've seen bad series finals, but THIS had to be the worst ever. I can't believe I watched the last four seasons and still pissed about how bad it was.

Watching the series now on Peacock, the show really didn't age well. Some of the jokes are still funny, but the sexist jokes, Judith's constant bad moods towards Alan, and Rose's constant obsession over Charlie look as out of place today as it did back then.

The show is not for everyone, but if you are curious, just stick with the Charlie Harper era and forget the Walden Schmidt era."

Season 12,"Feb 7, 2015",5,0,0,"Season 12 instead Two and a Half Men should be called Two and a Half Gay. Do not get me wrong I have nothing against gay population but 12 seasons is completely destroyed this series if this is a much heralded surprise then can only be understood as another major influence gay lobbyists and their struggle for rights ... The first eight seasons were excellent with great dialogue events and Charlie Sheen was fantastic with the arrival of Ashton these dialogues have become quite a sweetened but the series was still more than watchable , however, in the twelfth season, there is no longer any spirit or similarities with what the show was once . As I already said, has become the Two and a Half Gay ...

"Less funny, pretty much PC.","Dec 9, 2014",3,0,1,"Although i do chuckle at times, Those chuckles are delivered mostly because of ""Alan's"" continued CPR of the show.

Whats left is 2 soon to be gay men with ""Charlie's gay daughter"" cheering on their not very funny everyday.

""two an a half men"" pretty much died when Charlie Sheen left the stage, and i guess chuck lorre can hold a grudge.

Started well but,"Jun 1, 2020",5,0,0,"The first five seasons are great. However, as the series progresses, some characters are reduced to a mere characteristic, leaving their construction aside. For example, Jake was a bad student and yet he was smart like his uncle Charlie, but in time he was reduced to a disgusting idiot. Nor do I mention Alan (who was already elected chiropractor of the year) who was reduced to a more worthy character than in the early seasons. Charlie Sheen's game was what ruined the series forever, nothing against Aston Kutcher.

Two and a Half Men: A Guilty Pleasure with a Punchline,"Nov 14, 2024",5,0,0,"I'll admit it: Two and a Half Men is my kind of guilty pleasure. It's the perfect show to unwind to after a long day. The quick-witted banter and silly situations always manage to put a smile on my face.

Charlie Harper is the heart of the show, a charming rogue with a knack for trouble. His laid-back attitude and sarcastic humor are both endearing and hilarious. It's easy to see why so many people are drawn to his character.

Sure, the show isn't high-brow comedy, but it doesn't need to be. Sometimes, you just want a show that's easy to watch and makes you laugh. Two and a Half Men delivers on that front, time and time again."

Alan has taken the principal role of the series, being funnier than Ashton. Jake has become a principal character too. At first, when Charlie was acting in the series, he was the star, being the funnier of them all. Now that he is gone, Jake and Alan have been more involved in the role of being the ""stars"", better than Ashton because he is not funny for me."
Verdict is in...it's half a good show.,"Jan 13, 2021",5,0,6,"I didn't hate this show. It was way better than the big bang theory.

It's a show about literally 2 and a half men... It was about the typical stories in life made to be funny. It had the dorky nice father It had the sl*t maker And an awkward boy on the middle as their maid cleaned up their house.

It has some funny moments but still I rather watch reuns of Seinfeld. If it comes down to big bang theory or 2 and a half men. I'll definitely choose the 2AAHM.

Big bang theory is one of the worse shows of all time. I digress. Verdict: if you like parental comedy shows this one is for you."
This show can't really get any worse...,"May 12, 2014",1,0,1,"I used to be a really big fan of the show. In fact I still watch it every week but I kind of think that the Two-and-a-half-men era has come to an end for me. There has to happen a drastic change to the show so that I will continue watching it next year. I won't propose that Charlie somehow comes back, although this would be a very nice idea, but I suggest that the Cryer-Kutcher duo finally splits. It is not that Ashton is a bad actor, they just don't fit together.

In contrast to the first seasons this show is not anymore about a playboy who lives freely his life without any responsibility, a man who was admirable and also kind of a role model for teenagers and suppressed men. The writers are just trying to fill the new episodes with bad jokes and silly love stories, that are boring and without any quality. They have actually forgotten what made the show popular in the first place.

In my point of view the writers have only two options left, if they wish to stay on air a bit longer. They either have to get rid of Ashton and bring a new playboy in the house or they have to focus just on Walden and go in a new direction without Allan."
Comic?,"Aug 14, 2019",3,0,5,Which casting team ever thought Jon Cryer had any comic talent?
"Charlie, come back please 🙏","Feb 24, 2021",5,0,1,"Without Charlie Sheen this show is just sad and boring. Alan reaches the lawest of law, Ashton....well he tries his best. Just watch the first 8 seasons and having fun is guarantiered."
"""Comprehensive Review of Two and a Half Men""","Jun 11, 2023",4,0,8,"The TV series ""Two and a Half Men"" is one of the most famous comedy series in history, which lasted for 12 seasons.

The series is characterized by its satirical comedic style, which deals with everyday life issues in a funny and enjoyable way.

However, I believe that the series is average overall and it does not deserve the media hype surrounding it.

The series revolves around two main characters, two brothers who live together, and the younger son of one of them.

The series is full of hilarious comedic situations that make the viewer laugh out loud. However, I believe that the series suffers from some weak points that make it not worth watching.

One of the weak points is the script, where some situations and dialogues are repeated constantly, making the viewer feel bored. Also, some dialogues contain sexual and violent content, making the series unsuitable for family audiences.

In addition, the characters in the series do not have enough diversity, where the same characters and situations are repeated constantly. This makes the series lack excitement and suspense.

Overall, I believe that ""Two and a Half Men"" is average and it does not deserve the media hype surrounding it.

However, it contains some hilarious comedic situations that can make the viewer laugh personally I didn't like it i don't recommend it and I give it 4/10."
Hate that I love this,"Jun 12, 2017",3,0,3,"This is trash TV at its best. It's basically one step up from Jerry Springer. This show is not very funny, but Charlie Sheen is sexy (at least when he acted in this he was) and it's basically a guilty pleasure to watch and perv on him as us girls like to do sometimes. It's unrealistic the way so many hot women throw themselves at Charlie without him paying a penny. But it's entertainment none the less. I think they could have made this show funnier (and more realistic) if they portrayed Charlie as a self-obsessed goon who'd hit on women and get constantly rejected, but the writers seem to enjoy kissing Charlie's backside. Also watching the main character swan around his mansion, swan around the store spending a fortune on alcohol, not working can make those of us who don't have it so easy a quite envious. And the stupid laugh track can give you a headache. There's nothing to laugh about."
a 10 with Charlie sheen transforming in a 5 with Ashton Kutcher,"Mar 15, 2015",5,0,2,"Don t get me wrong , i have nothing with Ashton but after Charlie's departing i simply cant watch this it lacks chemistry and i think that Kutcher cant replace Charlie neither like an actor neither like a character (the best role of Charlie sheen s life after me) OK we get it Charlie was wrong and made a lot of mistakes,punish him for a period but why to punish us also with Ashton??? I watched this series and it was one from my favorites but i believe that the main reason for it now is missing. it is like you have a football team and you leave the best player out of the field.. If i will watch this series now i will watch it like something else not like 2 men and 1/2 but like something different....."
I'm giving 5 stars: right in the middle,"Jul 27, 2019",5,0,1,"Since this show is on (re-runs) at LEAST 8 hours a day, I can't help but to have seen it a few times, and of course I fell down the rabbit hole and became hooked, absolutely hooked. At least for the first seasons with Charlie Sheen. It was rude, crude and in bad taste - poop, fart, and blatant sex jokes, immoral behavior by all, and non-stop humiliation of Jon Cryer. It was hilarious! Very very funny, sometimes a little touching, funny acting by all, even the unspeakable mother. As time went on, it got less funny, and though Ashton Kutcher is adorable, when he came on the whole show just went to seed. It turned into non-stop shows about getting laid, 'polishing the knob', more getting laid. A...daughter of Charlie's? ... was brought in and I immediately hated her. The joke is she is a raging aggressive lesbian with the same voracious appetites of her father, only for women. She, like Charlie, sets her sights on anyone and everyone, just about every female on the show, who eagerly drop their drawers! (I have despised Rose ever since she first poked her head up over the railing the first time, I don't think she is cute or funny and as it turns out, was an extremely sick individual.)....Now I loved Berta, who has no F's to give and says what's on her mind. I've known a lot of Bertas in my life, hard working, struggling, but still a grim sense of humor. I loved the young Jake, till he turned into a Bevis and Butthead teen, and then...not so much. Charlie Sheen was always funny, bumbling about in his own drunken little world but collecting so many notches on his virtual bedpost it was probably whittled away to a virtual toothpick. Alan, fussy, annoying, envious Alan was the straight man....But then Waldon (Ashton Kutcher) who was as cute as a bug but not quite as funny. And unbelievable. And his wife who knew him back when couldn't find it in herself to live with a billionaire big fat BABY? Whut?? ... I haven't watched the final season, it sounds like a mean, unfunny, stupid fustercluck....And I often wonder, is this a parody or are the people in California (especially the women) such pushovers as depicted here? Perhaps so, it isn't set in bible beater country! And I'm not judging, for heavens sake, it might very well be normal in a town where looks and ambition and looking hot is common as can be. Very superficial. but early seasons, very funny! My 80 year old mother both trash-talked and adored the show, for some perverse reason - maybe envious of a lifestyle she certainly never had!"
Half a Man,"Oct 31, 2018",1,0,0,"This used to be a funny show. Charlie Sheen made it go : he was the figure that kept its integrity. I was shocked to return to civy street and the world were time was abundant. I discovered the CLOSED sign everywhere. I found it wasn't on two and a half men...no something much worse. They sacked the star and replaced him and the whole storyline with a unfunny , some say sick pc homocentric, betrayal of the original. Why couldn't they have just closed shop and left us with pleasant memories. Instead we got this bitter taste in the mouth. Is all comedy gay now?"
Pathetic...,"Sep 2, 2020",4,0,3,"I don t understand why Ashton try to look like Charlie... Ashton is funny in his way, Charlie very funny in his way, so why ? If u change the actor/ character, change his personality as well... what are u doing here trying to learn a fish to fly... let him swim let him be awesome in his way ..."
Charlie Sheen as a comedy star,"Jan 18, 2006",N/A,0,0,"I remember Charlie Sheen from Young Guns and that kind of Hollywood movies. He used to have serious roles which are usually boring.Two & a half men is something fresh for us because it's a great opportunity to watch Charlie Sheen as a fun character in a good sitcom.Despite all the bad things he had been through Two &a half men is a proof that he still can be a part of nice and fun work.Charlie is a handsome musician who gets along with women really well and sometimes he messes things up which may be the most interesting to watch.I want to thank everyone who persuaded Charlie Sheen to play the character Charlie because I can not imagine anyone else as Charlie Harper now.He fits in the character in a surprisingly fun way.After Two&a half men I decided that I prefer to watch him in a comedy.All i can say is ""don't miss this experience"""
feature film with the actors,"Nov 7, 2011",N/A,0,6,"I think you are doing a great great series. I hope it will be many more seasons.

I have a query if you have a plan to make a movie of two and a half man? as they did with Sex and the City. I think it will be a great success for you.

I can see in front of me where Walden needs to make a business trip and invite all the good company and then it happens lot of fun things. examples where they are staying at luxury hotels and during his stay there, even Playboy business meeting ...

Jake and Alan is the pool where lots of lovely women for sunbathing and swimming.

Walden, Alan and Jake to contact some of these women.

like to see a film with them

big fan

have a nice day

and I hope you do any of this

Greetings Jannica"
beach background outside the deck,"Oct 28, 2008",N/A,0,3,"I have now seasons 1 thru 4 and have enjoyed them all! Has anyone noticed (or am I hallucinating?) the beach background outside off the deck seems to have changed from season one beginning to now? The first episodes it seemed like it was a long way off and now it looks like a cliff-side close by. Just me thinking out loud and finally asking.....also anyone ever find a Clucky's?! I am hoping that Kandi will make a return also....she was hilarious and added some fun to the show. And I absolutely loved seeing Cloris Leachman. I hope they get other actors like that to come in every once in a while. And my boys can't get enough of ""squab!""....ok I am done!"
Witty... but Sheen!!,"Dec 8, 2003",N/A,0,8,"Two and a Half Men is a fairly funny show that keeps you interested. Charlie Sheen, although a good actor, is cast in the same roles, which causes it hard to tell the difference if he's Charlie Crawford from Spin City or Charlie Harper from Two and a Half Men! At times though he does have a character differentiation. Jon Cryer, is good, funny, and PERFECT for the role! He's that wimpy person that is PERFECT for the role. He's capture the coward in the character. And Agnus T. Jones is a young actor who could use some work but he has time. This show has it perks and downs, but watch it. It's funny, but if you're not looking for chuckle, then don't watch. If you are, then be my guest."
entertainment crises,"Dec 31, 2011",N/A,0,0,Just wondering WHY writer directors get mad at actors for THEIR PERSONAL LIVES? They are actors why should it matter what they do on their own time? just wondering why it has to ruin their career... what's the deal with certain people in the entertainment business who get mad at actors and mess up the show or their career. Just something random about entertainment why do they charge so much to go to the movies and so much for food? lol They seats are not that comfortable and the food kinda sucks these days what's the deal? If they didn't charge an arm and a leg they would make money and people would go more hardly anyone can afford a movie these days I use to go every week...

Anyway guys hope you can help me on the soundtrack thing ! thanks a lot ! Luke
Good but not enough,"Apr 29, 2012",N/A,0,4,"Still good, but just good. Taunts the previous chief actor was a mistake - the funeral and the comments against him. Everyone knows that the existence of the series makes sense only to the original composition. Script does not work the same way, no spirit. Had to continue with a whole new show - a new name, new house, new city even. Now the idea is drained as far as you can, but this is not satisfactory. // Summary: The Harper brothers Charlie and Alan are almost opposites but form a great team. They have little in common except their dislike for their mundane, maternally cold and domineering mother, Evelyn. Alan, a compulsively neat chiropractor and control-freak, is thrown out by his manipulative wife Judith who nevertheless gets him to pay for everything and do most jobs in the house. Charlie is a freelance jingle composer and irresistible Cassanova who lives in a luxurious beach-house and rarely gets up before noon. Charlie ""temporarily"" allows Alan and his son Jake, a food-obsessed, lazy school kid who shuttles between his parents, to move in with them after Alan's separation/divorce. The sitcom revolves around their conflicting lifestyles, raising Jake (who has the efficient, caring dad while having a ball with his fun-loving sugar uncle who teaches him boyish things), and bantering with Evelyn and various other friends and family"
The End,"Feb 19, 2015",N/A,0,0,"After Charlie Sheen, all we have really been watching is the credits roll....for 3 seasons

No matter how much i watch the show it just doesn't improve, but even gets worse!!

Now some facts to mention

1)Charlie Sheen WAS the show, Jon Cryer kind of pulled his weight abit even after Charlie Sheen, but most of the load was pulled by Sheen and when he was gone, we had a boring stalemate

2)Now we know that Ashton Kutcher is not a clone of Charlie Sheen and nobody expected him to BE Charlie Sheen, however the character he brought into the sitcom was not suited for the sitcom in the direction we had used to it going, it became a totally DIFFERENT show , you had to understand that the show did not give any indication that ti was going to change direction, all it did was switch the cards and hoped nobody seen the really OBVIOUS elephant in the room ....Ashton Kutcher is no Charlie Sheen

3) What made Charlie Sheen -> Charlie Harper was his life experience, he is one drunk, womanizing, lazy, lucky, charming, quick-witted individual, even his temperaments to be easily annoyed and hate his mother and freeloading brother was very natural for him

4)Charlie Sheen was also very ""wine/dine"" kind of guy put on a nice top and pants and he can fit into any background perfectly , or put on a bowling shirt and shorts and again he fits in perfectly

5) Ashton Kutcher......he is only good at playing a stoned nice guy that people take advantage of due to his simpleton nature , he is not a leading character because in life he doesn't come off as somebody who is the ""alpha"" male or leader of the pack, he might throw in a few funny comments, but he will never stir the boat and he even seems to sometime be outstaged by Jon Cryer in that it looks as if Ashton Kutcher is the poor leech while Jon Cryer is the billionaire

6) the first episode had a good setting when we are introduced to Ashton Kutcher's character, a kind of rich out of touch with the world, frigid, one girl kind of guy, who is easily taken advantage off and also despite genius, very stupid in real life matters, if Ashton Kutcher stayed like this the whole way through, this show could have survived, but the fact that eh tried to become Charlie Harper just ran away from him

7) All in all while watching the show it really felt as if i was watching another show all together with remnants of memory popping up every time i see 'Allan Harper' that jots back to memory reminds that its still Two and a half men despite that its really is an entirely all together different show"
I dont like ashton kutcher in it,"Aug 6, 2018",N/A,0,0,"I only watch the old ones with charlie sheen in it. I thought it was funnier and better, i dont like the newer ones"
